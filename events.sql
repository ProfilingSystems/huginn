The report examines key trends in the U.S., five major European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK) and Japan; reviews current and emerging assays; analyzes potential applications of innovative diagnostic technologies; forecasts volume and sales for molecular diagnostic, microbial identification, antibiotic susceptibility, blood culture, urine screening and immunodiagnostic procedures, as well as over 100 infectious disease tests by assay, application, market segment, and country; profiles leading players and potential market entrants; and suggests alternative business expansion strategies for suppliers. \",\"The level of automation in the microbiology laboratory has been lagging behind that of other major clinical laboratory segments, such as chemistry and hematology. The slow acceptance of the technology is in part due to the complexity of developing automation suitable for microbiology tests. \",\"The introduction of automated microbiology instrumentation has been delayed by a number of intrinsic and technical problems. The diffusion of automated microbiology systems, once the technology was developed, has not matched that of other automated laboratory technologies. The acquisition of automation in microbiology has been slowed by forces less easily identifiable than the effects of various reimbursement plans. Some laboratorians still believe that current instrumentation is not the ultimate technology and expect better automation on the horizon. \",\"The driving force behind the need for rapid reporting of microbiological test results is the clinical relevance in a time of financial austerity, a time when cost and health care effectiveness to the patient and diagnostician looms ever larger, and where after-the-fact results at high expense are coming under severe scrutiny worldwide. \",\"This comprehensive seven-country report will assist diagnostics industry executives, as well as companies planning to diversify into the dynamic and rapidly expanding microbiology market, in evaluating emerging opportunities and developing effective business strategies. \",\"Companies Mentioned \",\"- Abbott - Affymetrix - Agilent Technologies - Applied Gene Technologies - Arca Biopharma - Beckman Coulter/Danaher - Becton Dickinson - Biokit - bioMerieux - Bio-Rad - Biotest - Cepheid - CellMark Forensics/Lab Corp - Decode Genetics - Diad \",\"For more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4c2378/2016_global \",\"Media Contact: \",\"Laura Wood, +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\",\" \"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"no\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-20 23:27:53','2015-11-20 23:27:53',NULL),(9519,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/it-is-black-friday-now-at-gardner-white-300182810.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-20 17:06:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 17:06:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/it-is-black-friday-now-at-gardner-white-300182810.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/it-is-black-friday-now-at-gardner-white-300182810.html\"],\"description\":\"AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Nov. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --&#160;Gardner-White Furniture is pleased to announce that you can take advantage of the Black Friday Steals now before the holiday.&#160; \\\"Gardner-White is known for the best values on quality furniture an bedding.

In the US, S. aureus\' attributable mortality rates are as high as 50% for certain hospital-acquired infections. Current antibiotic therapies often fall short of medical need and may cause collateral damage to the patient\'s microbiome. In addition, it has become apparent in recent years that pathogenic cytotoxins produced by S. aureus play a significant role in preventing bacterial elimination by the host immune system, and traditional antibiotics do not address these important toxins. \",\"Eszter Nagy, Co-Founder, President, and Chief Scientific Officer of Arsanis commented, \\\"This is an important milestone for Arsanis and demonstrates our commitment to becoming a leader in the field of novel anti-infective antibodies.\\\" \",\"ASN100 was discovered in collaboration with Arsanis\' strategic partner Adimab LLC (Lebanon, NH, US), using its industry-leading antibody discovery platform.

BNSF refused to revise its wrongful 95% carriage requirement despite promises to the contrary, and by refusing to allow the Cold Train to ship more than 5% of its traffic on other railroads.  BNSF\'s unfair and deceptive trade practices were conducted in the course of its railroad business and caused significant harm to Mr. Lerner, Mr. Lawson, and Cold Train, LLC.  \",\"Cold Train was also greatly harmed by a significant slowdown in BNSF\'s service schedules on its Northern Corridor line beginning in the fall of 2013 because of increased rail congestion as a result of BNSF hauling larger volumes of oil and coal from the Northern Plains region.  In fact, from November of 2013 to April of 2014, BNSF\'s On-Time Performance (OTP) dramatically dropped from an average of over 90% to less than 5%.  To makes matters worse, in April of 2014, BNSF abruptly sent out an announcement to customers indicating that it would be immediately reducing its \\\"Z Train\\\" intermodal train service from Washington State to only one train a day from Washington State (instead of two), and that transit time would be twice as slow (3 days slower) from Seattle/Quincy to Chicago.  The sudden change of service quickly caught the attention of lawmakers at the State and Federal Level and became the subject of a US Senate Transportation Committee Hearing in Washington DC in 2014.\",\"In 2009, Steven Lawson and Mike Lerner had discussions with BNSF about starting a refrigerated intermodal shipping service in which the primary focus was to ship fresh produce grown in central Washington to retailers in the Midwest.  The success of this business hinged on consistent expedited Z train rail service between intermodal terminal in Quincy, Washington (which Cold Train leased from the Port of Quincy) and the BNSF\'s intermodal ramp in Chicago, Illinois. Additionally, before founding Cold Train, Mr. Lerner and Mr. Lawson obtained promises and representations from BNSF regarding the 72-hour service from Quincy to Chicago.  Based on this 72-hour service schedule promised by BNSF, Cold Train developed a business plan using refrigerated intermodal shipping containers that allowed fresh produce to be directly loaded into a refrigerated container, delivered by truck to the intermodal terminal at the Port of Quincy, and loaded onto an eastbound train the same day. \",\"The refrigerated intermodal rail service to/from Quincy, Washington proved to be very popular with both growers and retailers.  In fact, the service was being used by many of the top ten retailers, wholesalers, food processors and fresh shippers in the United States. \",\"Initially, BNSF required the Cold Train to acquire a minimum of 111 containers.  By May 2012, Cold Train had 175 containers in service with another 100 on order for delivery in January 2013.  Cold Train continued to purchase and lease containers, and by September 2013, Cold Train had over 400 refrigerated shipping containers in service, and was delivering refrigerated cargo from Quincy, Washington (and Portland, Oregon) to terminals in nineteen Midwest and East Coast states and one Canadian province.  \",\"During August 2013, Lawson and Lerner began looking for a capital partner to provide the needed funds to continue the expansion of the Cold Train\'s business.  In September 2013, BNSF\'s On-Time Performance (OPT) abruptly dropped to 81% and by February 2014 it had dropped to only 4%.  Throughout this time, BNSF continued to assure Cold Train that it was working hard to resolve the OTP issues and represented that timely, consistent service would be restored.  \",\"On January 13 and 14, 2014, Steven Lawson met with BNSF\'s representatives in Fort Worth, Texas, to inform them of an offer they had received to sell the Cold Train business to Federated Railways, Inc.  BNSF encouraged Lawson and Lerner to proceed with the sale, and as a result, Steven Lawson and Mike Lerner signed a letter of intent dated January 20, 2014, formalizing the deal with Federated. \",\"In March 2014, Steven Lawson and Federated met with BNSF representatives in Fort Worth to discuss the Cold Train\'s business and its future with BNSF.  At the meeting, BNSF continued to encourage Lawson, Lerner and Federated to proceed with the sale and promised another 5 year term of the existing Z train service at Quincy, WA.  Immediately thereafter, as a direct result of the encouragement, Federated provided Cold Train a $1.25 million capital infusion based solely on that meeting and then publicly announced that it was acquiring Cold Train.  \",\"In April 2014, BNSF\'s OTP dropped to a dismal 3%.  Cold Train repeatedly complained to the BNSF that the continued degradation of service was detrimental to the Cold Train\'s business and that if timely service was not restored, the viability of Cold Train was in serious jeopardy.  The extreme delays in service and low OTP ultimately caused Cold Train to lose most of its business as its customers refused to tolerate the delays.\",\"Despite the service failure, BNSF asked Cold Train and the Port of Quincy to enlarge the Port of Quincy Intermodal Terminal to accommodate larger trains.  BNSF wrote a letter dated April 24, 2014, to the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in support of the Port of Quincy\'s application for a TIGER VI grant, which would allow the Port to expand its intermodal facilities in Quincy.  \",\"Meanwhile, on the same day (April 24, 2014), BNSF informed Cold Train that it was cancelling the 72-hour service and substituting a new 125-hour service, effective the following business day.  In fact, on April 8th, just two weeks prior to notifying Lawson and Lerner of BNSF\'s decision to termination of the Z train service, BNSF issued a letter to Steven Lawson reaffirming its \\\"partnership\\\" and commitment to complete a new contract by June of 2014 to include incentives from BNSF to help with more investment on the part of Lawson, Lerner and Federated.\",\"As a result of the scheduling change by BNSF in April of 2014, BNSF\'s rail transit time nearly doubled.   This caused Cold Train\'s costs of equipment, fuel and other costs to double, and caused many customers, especially fresh produce shippers, to look for other transportation service options.  In fact, because of BNSF\'s scheduling issues (beginning in November 2013), Cold Train lost most of its fresh produce business, which was more than 70% of the company\'s business.  \",\"Because of BNSF\'s decision to terminate Cold Train\'s three day Z train service and replace it with six day Q train service, it took twice as much equipment, refrigeration fuel, etc. to move the same freight, which caused Cold Train to incur millions of dollars in operating losses and capital investment losses.  \",\"As a direct result of the service change and BNSF\'s refusal to revise its wrongful 95% carriage requirement despite promises to the contrary, Federated withdrew its offer to purchase the Cold Train.  In essence, Lawson and Lerner would walk away with nothing from a business that had been worth over $40 million prior to April 24, 2014.   Moreover, BNSF would not restore its 72-hour service, nor was it willing to provide any substantial concession or compensation to the Cold Train to make up for the ruinous effects of its abrupt change of service.  \",\"Additionally, the termination of the Z train service left numerous Washington State residents unemployed as well as many Washington State companies and other secured and unsecured creditors with significant receivables and debts.  Furthermore, BNSF has continued its extensive effort of bad faith and unfair dealings towards Lawson, Lerner, and the creditors of Cold Train by initiating negotiations with the Great Western Bank, the senior secured creditor, to extinguish its liability to the unsecured creditors, Lawson, Lerner and Federated by offering to buy the claim for pennies on the dollar against itself from the Rail Logistics estate in Kansas State court, without proper notice to the unsecured creditors.  The latest move by BNSF, if approved, would leave millions of dollars of unsecured creditor debt without any means of relief, all to the benefit of BNSF.  Several creditors have intervened in the Kansas Court, challenging this settlement agreement.\",\"For more

Have a strategy.  \\\"If you plan to head to the stores in the pre-dawn hours the day after Thanksgiving, come up with a plan before you walk out the door,\\\" said Bossler.  Know who you are buying for, what you want to buy and how much you are willing to spend.   So often we buy things because they are such a good deal, but it really ends up a waste of money. Don\'t be tempted to buy more than you need, just because it\'s a good deal.\",\"Cyber Monday and online shopping.  Your inbox will be bursting with \\\"TODAY ONLY!\\\" bargains.  Internet flash sales can be a great way to get a bargain, but, like Black Friday, before you start online shopping, take time to make a plan and stick to your list.  \",\"Many online sales encourage you to buy more than you need. Discounts or free shipping often are based on a minimum purchase.  This can encourage you to spend way more than you planned and buy more than you need.  \\\"Sometimes, it makes sense to pay for the shipping and forgo the discount,\\\" said Bossler. \\\"Don\'t buy something just to get free shipping, thinking you\'ll gift it to someone. Odds are, it will stay with you.\\\"\",\"But I deserve it! \\\"There are the sales at every turn, you see stuff you want, and you buy for yourself,\\\" said Bossler.  \\\"If you are trying to keep your spending in check, keep the focus on your list. Remember, someone is likely shopping for you, too.\\\"\",\"Kids are the reason for the season.  We all want to make sure that the little ones on our list have a good Christmas, but how often is the box your gift came in their favorite thing?  Think back to your childhood Christmas.  What made them special?  There is much more to making holidays special to kids, besides what you buy them.  \\\"How about a special afternoon listening to Christmas music and decorating the Christmas tree, watching holiday movies together or decorating Christmas cookies,\\\" says Bossler.  \\\"Making memories can be just as important as what is under the tree.\\\"\",\"Lastly, in looking at the entire holiday season, separate your budget into smaller sections, making it easier to control your money.  \\\"Inside decorations, outside decorations, sending cards, buying gifts, wrapping gifts, cooking and baking can add up,\\\" said Bossler. \\\"Dedicate a certain amount to each category and stick to it.\\\"\",\"As for some final encouraging advice, Bossler says: \\\"Focus your time on the things you like most. Keep it all in perspective and enjoy the holiday!\\\"\",\"For more information on GreenPath, or if you need help in setting up a budget, log on to www.greenpath.org or call (866) 648-8122.\",\"Keep up with GreenPath Debt Solutions online: www.facebook.com/greenpathdebt and www.twitter.com/greenpathdebt. \",\"About GreenPath Debt Solutions\",\"GreenPath Debt Solutions is a nationwide, non-profit financial counseling and education organization that assists consumers with credit card debt, housing debt, student loan debt and bankruptcy concerns.

Membranes are incorporated in water purifiers and filtration systems to provide purified water for residential as well as industrial usage. Majority of the population in India relies on water supplied from underground sources and water bodies for drinking purposes. Over the last decade, expansion of industrial sector in India and the resulting unchecked disposal of waste water has been increasing water pollution levels in the country\'s rivers. Deteriorating water quality in India is the principal factor for the surge in demand for water purifiers, consequently fueling demand for RO membranes in the country.\",\"     (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140117/663730 )\\n\",\"In 2014, the largest share of membranes market in India was accounted for by the residential segment, followed by wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical and food processing industries. In India, sewage generated from 35 metropolitan cities was estimated to be 15,644 Million Litres per Day (MLD), whereas the volume of sewage treated in these cities was 8,040 MLD. This reflects that the volume of sewage treated in these metropolitan cities accounted for roughly 51% of the total volume of sewage generated in the country. This wide gap between sewage generation and sewage treatment capacity is the prime reason behind the addition and upgradation of wastewater treatment and desalination plants in the country, thereby fueling demand for membranes in the country.

Após a liberação do hidrogênio deste carrier, a quantidade de hidrogênio armazenado é quase 100%, o que leva a uma rentabilidade muito alta. O carrier pode ser reutilizado através de um processo de reciclagem. \",\"Até a invenção da tecnologia H2Fuel, era difícil fazer o transporte e armazenamento de hidrogênio, que só poderia acontecer sob alta pressão ou com refrigeração extrema. A baixa rentabilidade, o perigo de explosões e a falta de uma rede de distribuição economicamente viável significavam que, em geral, o hidrogênio não poderia ser utilizado eficazmente. \",\"A tecnologia H2Fuel é a solução. Ela tem uma densidade de energia extremamente alta e é segura em formato líquido, o que a torna facilmente implementável em redes de distribuição existentes de combustíveis fósseis líquidos. \",\"O hidrogênio não libera emissões nocivas, ao contrário dos combustíveis fósseis que emitem CO2 (dióxido de carbono), NOx (óxido de nitrogênio) e NO2 (dióxido de nitrogênio), os principais causadores do aquecimento global, da mudança climática e da poluição do ar. \",\"Ao contrário do petróleo e gás, o hidrogênio está disponível sem limite e pode ser produzido em todo o mundo. A eletricidade (por meio de células de combustível) ou o calor (por meio de catalisadores) podem ser gerados a partir do hidrogênio. Por causa dessas vantagens, o hidrogênio é o substituto ideal para os combustíveis fósseis. \",\"A tecnologia H2Fuel também torna possível armazenar energia elétrica em grande escala, bem como transportar energia elétrica sem uma rede. Por exemplo, a energia renovável agora pode ser gerada em locais que dão mais lucro e então transportada para todo o mundo. \",\"A tecnologia H2Fuel torna possível converter motores de combustão usados em carros, navios e aviões em elétricos usando hidrogênio, que não produz emissões nocivas. O calor pode ser gerado em escala industrial ou doméstica, novamente sem quaisquer emissões nocivas. \",\"A tecnologia H2Fuel está construindo a ponte para a economia do hidrogênio, que trará consequências ecológicas e comerciais positivas. Uma delas é que o aquecimento global como resultado das emissões de CO2 pode agora ser interrompido.

Several bladder conditions, such as OAB, can be treated through simple lifestyle changes, simple behavior modifications, oral medical treatments, diet and exercise.\\\"\",\"Many people, especially women, are often too embarrassed to talk about their bladder health symptoms and think the occasional leakage that occurs from coughing or sneezing or that strong urge to urinate is a normal result of having children or getting older. Many wait on average, nearly two years before mentioning anything to their health care provider. \",\"About the Survey\",\"The survey of 1,000 adult Americans explores psychological, cultural and behavioral pressures surrounding openly discussing urinary habits. The survey also focuses on the language used to describe urinary habits, including regional/linguistic differences, the excuses people use for going to the bathroom and if they feel comfortable discussing urinary issues with their family and friends or healthcare providers, or if they keep to themselves.

Each adult female worm, which can live for up to 15 years in the human body, produces millions of microscopic offspring (microfilaria) that migrate through the skin, eyes, and lymph nodes. The microfilariae are the main cause of disease symptoms, which include severe skin inflammation and intense itching, enlarged lymph nodes and, in some patients, visual impairment that can ultimately lead to blindness. In sub-Saharan Africa, the disease affects more than 37 million people and approximately 115 million people are at risk of infection. Control and elimination of this disease currently relies on mass annual or biannual drug administration with ivermectin.  \",\"\\\"We are committed to realise the potential of moxidectin in the management of onchocerciasis and, subsequently, for a number of other important neglected diseases,\\\" said Mark Sullivan of Medicines Development for Global Health. \\\"We conducted a global search to identify the most experienced development experts to achieve the goal of registering this drug for human use.

The innovative company is working to eliminate the rapidly increasing driver shortage with its web- and mobile-based solutions that connect independent, professional (CDL-licensed) drivers with motor carriers who have job opportunities.\",\"Blue Bloodhound began its debut in Cincinnati, Columbus, Ohio, Indianapolis, Ind., and Louisville, Ky., important hubs for the transportation industry.  Drivers and motor carriers throughout the U.S. also have access to and are encouraged to sign-up and create their profile at this time. \",\"Blue Bloodhound answers a very real need that has been plaguing the U.S. transportation industry for years. According to the American Trucking Association (ATA), the driver shortage is reaching 50,000 and could go as high as 175,000 by 2024 if common industry practices are not changed. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average age of a commercial driver in the U.S. is 55. This is particularly troubling in states like Ohio where, according to the Ohio Development Services Agency, more than 25 percent of the current population is 55 or older.\",\"Blue Bloodhound empowers CDL drivers by letting them operate as fully independent contractors, experiencing the freedom and flexibility previously reserved for owner-operators. The easy-to-use app simplifies the traditional and often difficult application process by allowing drivers to create a Driver Qualification file as an independent contractor, enabling motor carriers to verify qualified drivers and determine availability in minutes. The intuitive technology serves as a vital connecting piece that expands the database of potential drivers for the carriers while providing drivers with more options for jobs as well as greater transparency in compensation structure.\",\"\\\"The recruitment and retention challenges facing our industry can be mitigated by giving drivers the right tools to fuel their entrepreneurial spirit,\\\" said Todd Warner, Blue Bloodhound COO. \\\"Our technology gives drivers and motor carriers a secure platform in which they can connect faster and more reliably. When drivers spend more time pulling freight and less time pushing paperwork, everyone wins.\\\"\",\"Blue Bloodhound also believes that this new technology will aid in the recruitment of the next generation of truck drivers, who grew up with smart phones in their pockets.\",\"\\\"We are trying to break down barriers in our industry that simply don\'t need to exist in our modern world,\\\" continued Warner. \\\"Similar technology has already been adopted by other industries. Our product will attract and retain a new crop of drivers looking to make a career on the road.\\\"\",\"For more information on Blue Bloodhound, visit www.bluebloodhound.com.  \",\"Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151123/290140LOGO \"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"yes\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-23 16:56:15','2015-11-23 16:56:15',NULL),(9860,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dubai-hosts-the-27th-annual-meeting-of-the-arab-division-of-the-international-academy-of-pathology-iap-ad-and-the-second-emirates-pathology-conference---espc-2015-553030021.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-23 11:07:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 11:07:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dubai-hosts-the-27th-annual-meeting-of-the-arab-division-of-the-international-academy-of-pathology-iap-ad-and-the-second-emirates-pathology-conference---espc-2015-553030021.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dubai-hosts-the-27th-annual-meeting-of-the-arab-division-of-the-international-academy-of-pathology-iap-ad-and-the-second-emirates-pathology-conference---espc-2015-553030021.html\"],\"description\":\"DUBAI, UAE, November 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\\n\\nUnder the patronage of HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Minster of Finance, President of the Dubai Health Authority, The 27th Annual Meeting of the Arab Division of The International Academy of Pathology (IAP-AD) and The 2n\",\"content\":\"DUBAI, UAE, November 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\\n\\nUnder the patronage of HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Minster of Finance, President of the Dubai Health Authority, The 27th Annual Meeting of the Arab Division of The International Academy of Pathology (IAP-AD) and The 2n\",\"title\":\"Dubai Hosts The 27th Annual Meeting of The Arab Division of The International Academy of Pathology (IAP-AD) and the Second Emirates Pathology Conference - ESPC 2015\",\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[],\"copy\":[\"DUBAI, UAE, November 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\",\"Under the patronage of HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Minster of Finance, President of the Dubai Health Authority, The 27th Annual Meeting of the Arab Division of The International Academy of Pathology (IAP-AD) and The 2nd Emirates Surgical Pathology Conference (ESPC 2015), will be held jointly between 25th and 28th November 2015, at the Conrad Hotel, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, under the theme \\\"New Horizons in Pathology\\\".\",\"     (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151123/290151 )\\n\",\"According to Dr. Mouza Al Sharhan, President of The Emirates Pathology Society, President of the Emirates Medical Association, and Council Member of the Arab Division, \\\"The practice of Anatomical Pathology mostly involves making microscopic diagnoses, often of serious diseases, in which in-depth clinical and basic science knowledge is required.\\\"\\n\",\"\\\"Today, the anatomical pathologist\'s findings are fundamental to medical diagnosis, where up to 70% of clinical decisions related to patient management and research, are based on laboratory test results.

Relational aggression includes using gossip and social exclusion to harm others, which is the most common form of aggression among girls. \",\"Published in the journal Psychology of Violence, the study was a randomized control trial with third- to fifth-grade urban African-American girls to evaluate the effectiveness of the Friend to Friend (F2F) aggression prevention program.\",\"F2F is the first and only relational aggression intervention to demonstrate a decrease in relationally aggressive behaviors among urban minority girls that continued at least a year after the conclusion of the program. Specifically, it improved the girls\' social problem-solving knowledge and decreased their levels of relational aggression.  \",\"\\\"Including this type of positive skill development in urban school curricula is important because children attending inner-city, under-resourced schools are at high risk for emotional and behavioral problems,\\\" says psychologist Stephen Leff, PhD, the study\'s lead author, and co-director of the Violence Prevention Initiative (VPI). \\\"There is evidence that having these skills and positive leadership opportunities increases the students\' resilience and leads to better future social interactions. This positive approach is infused into the school-based prevention programs that are part of our Violence Prevention Initiative at CHOP.\\\"\",\"The study team developed and refined the program through more than a decade of committed research at CHOP, in partnership with key community stakeholders. \\\"This partnership approach was used to develop F2F curricula, as well as the innovative teaching modalities utilized in the program, such as cartoons, videos, and role-plays,\\\" says Brooke Paskewich, PsyD, a psychologist and VPI program manager. \\\"Involving students, teachers, and parents in the design of the program helped to ensure its cultural sensitivity, developmental appropriateness, and engagement of urban minority youth.\\\"  \",\"F2F is a 20 session pull-out small group program that is conducted for 40 minutes over the lunch-recess period. It teaches social problem-solving strategies and provides opportunities for the girls to co-lead classroom sessions of F2F for their peers. A pilot study published in 2009 established the promise of F2F in decreasing relational aggression among elementary school-aged girls in two urban elementary schools. \",\"The current study involved 144 relationally aggressive girls from 44 different classrooms across six elementary schools in the School District of Philadelphia. The researchers used peer report measures to determine eligibility for the intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to either F2F or to a control group that used a homework and study-skills development program. \",\"\\\"Teachers were vital implementation partners for us, particularly in reinforcing newly learned pro-social skills and strategies outside of the structured sessions,\\\" says Leff. \\\"Having their buy-in and support was essential.\\\" \",\"The study group found significant improvements on self-report and teacher-report measures completed before and after implementing the program. In a one year follow-up, the participants\' new teachers completed the same measures about the students\' social behaviors as their previous teachers the year before. Notably, the new teachers were unaware of the girls\' aggressive and intervention status, a fact that helped to strengthen the validity of the findings.\",\"\\\"This study demonstrates not only the effect of a specific aggression prevention program, but also the promise of curricula that emphasize social problem-solving and leadership skills to reduce relational aggression in urban schools,\\\" says Leff.\",\"About The Violence Prevention Initiative at The Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia: The Violence Prevention Initiative (VPI) was established in 2013 as a CHOP-wide effort to interrupt the cycle of violence.

As the Chinese government eliminated export quota for rare earths, global NdFeB output will continue to grow to 143 kt in 2015.China is the world\'s largest NdFeB producer with an output of 112 kt in 2014 (88.1% of the global total), up 19.0% year on year. In 2015, due to ceaseless decline in NdFeB price, China will produce 127 kt throughout the year, gaining by 13.5% from a year ago.Nowadays, around 75% of NdFeB is used in traditional fields (electro-acoustic devices, magnetic separation, consumer electronics, etc.), while only 25% finds application in new fields (inverter air-conditioners, new energy vehicles, and energy-saving elevators). Compared with stable demand from traditional fields, the demand for NdFeB from new applications, especially new energy vehicles, increases significantly. According to the statistics, new energy vehicles\' consumption of NdFeB was 439 tons in China in 2014 when 79,000 new energy vehicles were manufactured, and is expected to further rise to 946 tons in 2015 when the country\'s new energy vehicle output will witness a spectacular rise (to an estimated 178,000). As downstream demand grows steadily and upstream raw material resources are abundant in China, the world\'s major NdFeB companies have made their presence here and continued to expand capacity.Hitachi Metals: The largest NdFeB manufacturer in Japan where is the home to most of its production bases. The company decided in Jun 2015 to set up a joint venture- Hitachi Metals San Huan Magnetic Materials (Nantong) Co., Ltd. with Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan Hi-Tech Co., Ltd.

They have a vital use in the treatment of chronic diseases and also result in high profit margins for the drug developers. There are several therapeutic areas for which biopharmaceuticals are being investigated; these include oncology, metabolic disorders, viral infections, genetic disorders and immunological disorders. Biotherapeutics (both approved and under investigation) include monoclonal antibodies, cell therapies, clotting factors, cytokines, enzymes, hormones and vaccines. In fact, several antibody based therapies have already been approved across the globe. Humira®, by AbbVie, is a well-known example; the drug has been generating multibillion dollar sales annually for several years.The major challenge for biologics has been the mode of administration. For most large molecule drugs, IV is an established route. Through this method, the drug directly enters systemic circulation bypassing degradation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, there are other challenges; these include the requirement of healthcare experts for drug administration (in turn, increasing the cost of therapy) and associated pain during therapy administration (negatively impacting patient compliance).Companies developing biologics are continuously on the lookout for novel formulation and delivery systems in order to exploit their full therapeutic and commercial potential. Amongst the various aspects being studied, technologies for facilitating oral, subcutaneous (SC) and transdermal delivery of biologics are highly sought after and have received widespread attention from researchers and manufacturers across the globe.Several start-ups, with innovative technologies, have surfaced in the past decade and have continuously encouraged the use of biotherapeutics by providing novel approaches to improve patient compliance. These technologies are broadly classified either as formulation technologies (approaches with primary objective of changing the formulation of drug, thereby facilitating an alternate route of administration in many cases) or delivery systems (approaches with primary objective of developing a physical system to deliver the drug via an alternate route).The overall interest continues to rise as is evident from the number of partnerships / agreements that have taken place amongst the stakeholders. Technology licensing agreements have been very common and are likely to play an active role in industry\'s development. In addition, several venture capitalists have led multiple funding rounds in these companies, acting as a key enabler behind the evolution.SCOPE OF THE REPORTThe \'Biotherapeutics: Novel Formulation and Delivery Approaches (Focus on Antibodies and Proteins)\'report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current market landscape and the future outlook of technologies focused on the formulation and delivery of biotherapeutics, primarily proteins and antibodies. Biopharmaceuticals has become an area of heavy interest for many pharmaceutical companies; they make up about one-third of all the drugs that are currently in development. The industry is growing at a healthy pace resulting in a substantial shift from conventional chemical synthesis to biotechnological processes in the way drugs are now produced. Intravenous (IV) route has been the most popular route for administering large molecule drugs such as proteins and antibodies. However, with the rising popularity of biologics and biosimilars, several companies are now looking forward to technologies that can be used for delivering biotherapeutics via a route other than IV injection or infusion. Technologies focused on oral, SC and transdermal routes are becoming more popular and, therefore, are expected to be the major contributors to the overall drug delivery technologies market. In addition, there are other novel targeted approaches, such as bypassing blood brain barrier, which are likely to change the industry paradigm in the long run.During the course of our research, we identified 122 such companies that are developing either formulation technologies or novel systems for delivery of large molecule drugs. The study not only provides the list of technologies but also includes a detailed analysis on the overall market for these technologies. We have looked at the investments that have been made into these technologies and have provided detailed information of the various collaborations / licensing agreements amongst the stakeholders. This advancing trend of transition from IV to alternate delivery mechanisms highlights the crucial role of technology developers in this field.The base year for the report is 2015. The report provides the market forecast for the period 2015-2025. The research, analysis and insights presented in this report are backed by a deep understanding,developed from both primary and secondary research, of key drivers behind the growth.RESEARCH METHODOLOGYMost of the data presented in this report has been gathered via secondary research.

Our insights are backed by discussions with several stakeholders in the industry.Chapter 12 provides a SWOT analysis of the drug delivery technologies market for biotherapeutics, giving strategic insights to the major factors that are likely to drive future growth whilst highlighting the weaknesses and threats that may negatively impact the industry\'s evolution.Chapter 13 is a collection of transcripts of interviews conducted with key players during the course of this study. Chapter 14 summarises the overall report. In this chapter, we provide a recap of the key takeaways and an independent future outlook based on the research and analysis described in earlier chapters.Chapter 15 is an appendix, which provides tabulated data and numbers for all the figures provided in the report.Chapter 16 is an appendix, which provides a list of companies and organisations mentioned in the report.EXAMPLE HIGHLIGHTS1. There are over 150 technologies, being developed by around 120 companies, which are focused on developing novel formulations and / or systems for delivering antibodies and proteins. Amongst the delivery systems, prime focus of the stakeholders is on oral, SC and transdermal drug delivery technologies.2. The market has attracted several start-ups; these companies, in collaboration with big pharma, are expected to foster more innovation in the near future. Some of the well-known players with proprietary technologies are (in alphabetical order) Adocia, Aegis Therapeutics, Arecor, Corium International, Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, Durect Corporation, Emisphere Technologies, Excelse Bio, Generex Biotechnology, Halozyme Therapeutics, Merrion Pharmaceuticals, Oramed Pharmaceuticals, Rani Therapeutics, Xeris Pharmaceuticals and Zosano Pharma (complete list in Chapter 4 of the report).3. These approaches focus on a wide range of mechanisms; amongst others, these include modifying the release properties along with pharmacokinetic properties, creating cold-chain free and stable liquid formulations of the drug and delivering the drugs in a targeted manner.4. Within the technologies focused on targeted delivery, there seems to be heavy focus on delivery of drugs across the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). Delivery across the BBB has been a big challenge in case of large sized biologics. We have identified over 15 players, which aim to successfully overcome this challenge in the coming few years.5. Venture capitalists have shown an enormous amount of interest and confidence in the technology developers. In total, we traced over 200 instances of funding with the total investment amounting to an encouraging sum of USD 2.9 billion over the last decade. In addition, government agencies, such as the NIH, have also encouraged technology developers by issuing grants for a wide range of research projects.6. Driven by several factors, such as rising incidence of chronic diseases, growing popularity of biologics / biosimilars and use of delivery / formulation technologies as life cycle management tools for near patent expiry drugs, the market for such technologies is expected to grow aggressively at a healthy annual growth rate of 9.6% between 2015 and 2025.Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3411191/About ReportbuyerReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishershttp://www.reportbuyer.com\",\"For more information: Sarah Smith Research Advisor at Reportbuyer.com Email: query@reportbuyer.com  Tel: +44 208 816 85 48 Website: www.reportbuyer.com \"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"no\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-23 19:10:35','2015-11-23 19:10:35',NULL),(10110,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidewater-to-present-at-the-cowen--company-5th-annual-ultimate-energy-conference-300183374.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-23 13:51:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 13:51:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidewater-to-present-at-the-cowen--company-5th-annual-ultimate-energy-conference-300183374.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidewater-to-present-at-the-cowen--company-5th-annual-ultimate-energy-conference-300183374.html\"],\"description\":\"NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tidewater Inc.

Among the many neurological disorders are chronic pain (including migraine headache), epilepsy, hearing loss, incontinence, major depression, Parkinson\'s disease, sleep apnea, and visual impairment/blindness. Typically, the initial treatment option for these conditions is standard pharmacotherapy or surgery; however, neurostimulation is gaining in popularity as a viable alternative among many people in the U.S. and worldwide. The estimated number of neurostimulation implant procedures has more than doubled over the past decade, reaching more than 1 million worldwide.Implantable neurostimulation systems typically consist of three implantable components (the extension, lead, and power source) and two external components (the control magnet and a handheld programmer). The extension is used to connect the lead to the power source, and the lead is used to deliver the electrical stimulation to the targeted nerve(s).For the purposes of this report, the total U.S. market for implantable neurostimulation devices includes sales derived from systems for 8 therapy segments, including the 5 core, established areas of deep brain stimulation (DBS), gastric nerve stimulation (GNS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), sacral nerve stimulation (SNS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), as well as neural prostheses (cochlear and recently launched retinal implants) and newly FDA-approved Vagal Blocking (VBLOC) therapy, for the treatment of obesity.The large and burgeoning market for implantable neurostimulation devices in the U.S. has reached nearly $2.3 billion in 2014. Despite the lingering economic uncertainty and financial constraints that have affected many other medical device markets, this market is undergoing significant technological advancement due to heavy R&amp;D and investment efforts by dozens of startups and leading medical device companies. The market is expected to experience high single-digit growth over the next half-decade, with many industry experts expecting its value to rival the multibillion-dollar markets for implantable defibrillators and coronary stents. A major reason for such optimism is not only the products\' clinical and commercial success thus far, but also the need for more effective treatments for the large population of patients who suffer from debilitating, chronic, incurable conditions that require the long-term management of symptoms.This dynamic, new report from Medtech Insight includes analyses of dozens of selected products, current/forecast markets (from 2014-2019), disease prevalence, competitors, market share by supplier, and opportunities in the U.S. Neurostimulation Devices Market. Specifically, this report covers leading and emerging implantable neurostimulation devices and next-generation technologies, as well as increasingly competitive less invasive or nonsurgical therapies, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS), and external trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS).Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03384800-summary/view-report.htmlAbout Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

Although it is not as strong and stiff as composites based on carbon fiber, but it is less brittle, and its raw materials are much cheaper. Its bulk strength and weight are also better than many metals, and it can be more readily molded into complex shapes. The glass fibers are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and boron. Applications of fiber glass include aircraft, boats, automobiles, bath tubs and enclosures, swimming pools, hot tubs, septic tanks, water tanks, roofing, pipes, cladding, casts, surfboards, and external door skinsAsia-Pacific is the global leader in the consumption of fiber glass and this dominance is expected to continue till 2020. China is the key market in this region, consuming more than half of the demand for fiber glass followed by Japan, wherein the consumption is growing steadily. An increase in the consumption of fiber glass in composite applications has been observed in Asia-Pacific due to competition from carbon fiber and rockwool. Production facilities of fiber glass are majorly concentrated in Asia-Pacific. The continuous growth and innovation, along with industry consolidations, are projected to ascertain a bright future for this industry.The fiber glass market is segmented on the basis of types, such as rovings, yarns, and others. The roving segment dominates the global fiberglass market on the basis of type. The growth is driven by its extensive use in automotive, aerospace and wind energy applications mainly as reinforced composites. Some niche applications of roving include sports equipment and safety gear.On the basis of applications, composites account for more than two-thirds of the fiberglass market share. Increasing construction and industrial spending in emerging economies, such as China and India is likely to generate more demand of composites. In addition, shift in trend towards use of light weight and strong composite materials in wind energy and automotive will have a positive impact on the market growthThis study aims to forecast the market value for fiber glass from 2015 to 2020. The fiber glass market has been segmented on the basis of types, application and region .The region is further segmented into countries covering China, Japan, Germany, the U.K., France, Italy, Russia, and the U.S. The segmentation by application includes composites, insulation, and others. Further, as a part of qualitative analysis, this research analysis provides a comprehensive review of major market drivers, restraints, opportunities, burning issues, challenges, and key issues in the fiber glass market. This study also includes company profiling and the competitive strategies adopted by different market players, including Jushi group (China), Owens Corning (U.S.), and Saint-Gobain Vetrotex (France).

As previously announced, we are taking decisive action to return the Company to an acceptable level of profitability, including consolidating six manufacturing facilities to three, right-sizing our Canadian dry-type transformer operations, the largest phase of which occurred on October 31, and outsourcing certain lower margin, less value-added activities to lower cost facilities.\\\" \",\"\\\"These efforts are proceeding ahead of schedule with no loss in order rates as originally budgeted, though this progress is masked in our results by non-cash charges related to our restructuring and integration, as well as by a recently discovered payroll tax compliance issue that resulted in a $1.2 million charge for accrued interest and penalties during the quarter,\\\" continued Mr. Mazurek. \\\"The expense reductions at Bemag created a solid foundation for profitable growth, and we have now experienced two consecutive quarters of increased orders and the backlog today for this element of our business is the highest it has been in nine months.

These changes not only reduce our on-going cost structure, but also should enable us to compete more effectively.\\\"\",\"\\\"Further bolstering our long-term confidence in profitable growth is the strong performance of our recent acquisitions,\\\" added Mr. Mazurek. \\\"Titan is on pace for its highest annual revenue in its entire history of operations, and this acquisition continues to add a steady, growing base of recurring service revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Our most-recent acquisition, Pacific Power Systems Integration, is exceeding expectations. The backlog for this business has grown to $2.4 million, based on $1.7 million in new orders since the acquisition in August of 2015. As expected, this acquisition has significantly enhanced our competitive advantages. We can now leverage our full suite of engineered product solutions, enabling us to capitalize on new production and internal supply chain synergies and benefit from higher gross margins due to the fact that we will be more involved in the integration of custom, purpose-built solutions.\\\"\",\"\\\"While our long-term outlook is improving due to the concrete steps we have taken to improve our profitability and competitiveness, our 2015 results are impacted by order delays, as well as unfortunate and unexpected non-operational charges,\\\" continued Mr. Mazurek. \\\"These challenges have not impacted our confidence in 2016, and in fact the order delays should provide incremental benefit to our 2016 revenue and profitability. We expect to provide more clarity on our 2016 outlook when we announce our fourth quarter results in March, when we will also have more information on the cost reduction initiatives and the payroll tax issue.\\\"\",\"Third Quarter 2015 Financial Highlights\",\"Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Highlights\",\"Revenue\",\"Total revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 decreased to $24.9 million, down 4.5%, or $1.2 million, from $26.1 million during the same period last year. The decrease was driven by the $4.6 million decrease in revenue from the Company\'s transformer product lines in its T&amp;D Solutions segment which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from the Company\'s Critical Power Solutions segment, led by the acquisition of Titan.\",\"For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, total revenue increased by $12.2 million, or 17.9%, to $80.3 million, up from $68.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue in the Critical Power Solutions segment as a result of the Titan acquisition, which was partially offset by a decrease in transformer sales in the T&amp;D Solutions segment. The T&amp;D Solutions segment was impacted by continued weakness in Canadian market conditions, unexpected customer delivery delays and the effect of foreign currency translation. Sales to U.S. customers were robust, driven mostly by demand for custom magnetics in the Company\'s OEM sales channel, together with increased brand label sales and commercial construction activity.\",\"Service revenue, most of which originates from recurring preventative maintenance contracts for backup power systems, grew to 8.4% of total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to 0.1% of total revenue during the same period last year. \",\"Gross Margin\",\"For the third quarter, the gross margin percentage was 19.4% of revenues, as compared to 25.7% during the third quarter of 2014. The 6.3% decrease in consolidated gross margin percentage is explained mostly by lower sales of liquid-filled transformers within the Company\'s larger T&amp;D Solutions segment, and was also driven by the Critical Power Solutions segment, which included lower sales of paralleling switchgear in 2015, as compared to the same quarter of 2014.\",\"For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the gross margin percentage was 18.9% of revenues, compared to 23.2% during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily the result of an unfavorable sales mix shift within the T&amp;D Solutions segment due to challenging demand and sales mix factors in Canada, affecting all transformer categories. Higher throughput and sales by U.S. T&amp;D operations offset nearly half of the decline in gross profit dollars from Canada, but at a lower average gross margin. On the Critical Power side of the business, the decrease in gross margin percentage was due mostly to the timing of the Titan acquisition, together with a lack of major projects completed in 2015 by the original Critical Power business focused on paralleling switchgear. \",\"Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA\",\"Operating loss for the third quarter was down from operating income of $2.8 million during the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in operating income in the third quarter of 2015, before restructuring charges, was primarily a result of lower sales and gross profit from the Company\'s Canadian businesses, particularly in the utility sales channel, as well as in the Company\'s short-cycle, distribution transformer product lines where the economic downturn and adverse effect of a stronger U.S. dollar has been felt hardest. Operating loss was also negatively impacted by $0.4 million in a non-cash amortization expense related to intangible assets arising from the Titan acquisition.\",\"For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the operating loss was down from operating income of $4.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in operating income was the result of lower sales and gross profit from the Company\'s Canadian business, but was driven mostly by restructuring, integration and impairment expenses related to the Company\'s improvement initiatives.\",\"Approximately $5.2 million of the Company\'s expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of non-cash expenses including impairments of assets, depreciation and amortization, as compared to $1.5 million during the same period of 2014. Without the effect of these non-cash expenses, the Company\'s Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $1.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as compared to $3.2 million and $5.7 million in the year ago periods.\",\"During the quarter, Pioneer recognized a charge of approximately $1.2 million representing estimated accrued interest and potential penalties for failure to timely file payroll tax returns and make payments. The Company intends to pay the interest portion of the assessment when an account statement is received from the IRS. Due to the circumstances that led to the failure to file and make payments, the Company has submitted a request for the penalties to be abated. To the extent its request may be accepted, any penalties recognized this quarter that are subsequently overturned will be reflected as a gain in the Company\'s consolidated statements of operations in future periods. \",\"\\\"Understandably, our bank has taken precautionary measures due to this development and our recent financial performance, but they have also responded by making up to $3 million in financing available from our Canadian facilities for working capital, including to pay down our payroll tax obligation. Although we do not expect to have a long-term resolution with our bank until we have additional information from the IRS and improvement in our financial performance, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to navigate this unfortunate situation,\\\" added Mr. Mazurek. \",\"Net Earnings (Loss) and Per Diluted Share\",\"Inclusive of the $1.2 million accrual for interest and potential penalties related to federal payroll taxes and the $3.4 million of restructuring expenses, the Company generated a net loss of $3.6 million and $4.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, as compared to net earnings of $1.8 million and $2.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. Net loss per basic and diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was ($0.48) and ($0.62), respectively, compared to net earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.25 and $0.37 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2014. \",\"\\\"In the aggregate, the restructuring charges and the payroll tax charges impacted our earnings by $4.7 million,\\\" commented Andrew Minkow, Pioneer\'s Chief Financial Officer. \\\"These charges represent a swing of $5.4 million compared to the year-ago quarter, exceeding the change in our net loss. These charges mask the progress we have made in the last 120 days in our efforts to meaningfully improve operations. We expect there to be up to $1 million more in restructuring and integration expense in the fourth and first quarters, but look forward to cleaner quarters in 2016.\\\"\",\"On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported net earnings of approximately $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2015, or $0.03 per diluted share, as compared to non-GAAP net earnings of $2.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2014. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, non-GAAP earnings were approximately $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, down from $3.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2014. Please refer to the financial tables included below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results and guidance.\",\"Backlog\",\"Order backlog at September 30, 2015 was $30.0 million, up 9.3% as compared to $27.5 million at September 30, 2014, and down 8.4% as compared to $32.8 million at June 30, 2015. Backlog is based on orders expected to be delivered in the future, most of which is expected to occur during the next twelve months.\",\"Outlook\",\"The Company adjusted its full-year 2015 guidance based on business trends and the current composition of the order backlog. In 2015, the Company expects:\",\"For full year 2016, the Company\'s preliminary guidance is:\",\"Mr. Mazurek added, \\\"While still preliminary, we remain confident in our ability to meet or exceed full-year 2016 guidance, due to the success of our restructuring efforts and better than expected contribution from the acquisition of Pacific Power Systems Integration. We expect to provide more clarity when we report full-year 2015 results in March of 2016.\\\"\",\"Conference Call Information Pioneer will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET.

With the global prevalence continuing to rise, the disease has placed significant burden on healthcare expenditure, as it is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer.Anti-obesity pharmacotherapy can be used as an adjunct lifestyle modification to improve weight loss in order to significantly reduce obesity-associated health risks in obese patients. However, the use of currently available anti-obesity drugs is largely limited by poor long-term safety and a modest weight loss effect. Despite substantial clinical and regulatory challenges, the early-stage obesity pipeline remains robust, containing a high level of first-in-class innovation that has the potential to be translated into effective and safe weight loss treatments.ScopeHistorically, the obesity market has suffered from long-term safety concerns and modest efficacy with current treatments, both of which contribute to the low prescription rate and limited widespread use.- What are the main safety concerns that lead to significant challenges in gaining drug approval in obesity?- Why is sustainable weight loss difficult to achieve, and what is the implication for future drug development?Analysis reveals a high level of innovation and diversity in the pipeline, with 75 first-in-class programs identified to act on 60 unique molecular targets.- What is the dominant target family across these first-in-class pipeline products?- How well do they align with the underlying signaling pathways governing the central and peripheral regulation of food intake, and energy expenditure?Some first-in-class targets are deemed more likely to be developed into marketable treatments than others, having demonstrated substantial body weight reduction in Preclinical studies and addressing multiple mechanisms underpinning the development of obesity.- What is the scientific rationale behind these targets?

Internal DFS policy documents filed in court advised employees they should not win too much money on competing websites. ESPN reported internal board minutes that suggest DraftKings may have knowingly violated Federal law. A newly filed class action by the fans name Visa, MasterCard and American Express, among others, in a RICO suit accusing them of participating in a racketeering scheme facilitating illegal gambling. Another Florida lawsuit names DraftKings and FanDuel, along with the NBA, MLS, affiliates of MLB and NHL, various media companies and banks and payment processors as defendants for racketeering among other things. More than 36 lawsuits have been filed in just over 6 weeks. \",\"Meanwhile, DraftKings has retained David Boies, arguably one of the top legal talents in the country. In addition to trying to shift the conversation back to the skill vs. chance argument, a battle which the New York Attorney General doesn\'t need to win to prevail in court, Mr. Boies is quick to highlight the fact that FanDuel and DraftKings have been operating in New York for years, potentially implying that since they haven\'t been caught so far, it\'s too late for action. \",\"\\\"DraftKings and FanDuel are collecting headlines almost as fast as John Oliver\'s video is collecting views,\\\" said veteran actor Zack Ward, who played \'Scut Farkus\' in A Christmas Story. \\\"I mean... I may need to hire a personal assistant to keep up to date on all of this. Daily fantasy sports betting is dead in New York, period. Why does it matter that they have been there for a few years? Is the Attorney General supposed to turn a blind eye to illegal gambling just because he didn\'t take action before? By the same logic, cops shouldn\'t stop cars going 90 mph when the speed limit is 65 and just let them continue to be a threat to everybody else because they haven\'t been caught in the first 5 miles. That\'s completely ridiculous nonsense.\\\"\",\"NHL Legend Bernie Nicholls echoes Mr. Ward\'s view: \\\"With the death of daily fantasy sports betting looking like it\'s just around the corner, I can\'t help but think that this is a good thing. Fans can go back to cheering for their favorite real-world team like it should be, rather than cheering for a mish-mash of players from different and competing teams. DraftKings and FanDuel had their moment in the sun and they decided to cram tons of obnoxious ads down our throats rather than work to legalize and legitimize their products. But, since you can\'t keep gambling from destroying sports, and daily fantasy is obviously gambling, I suppose they had no choice. However, we DO have a choice.\\\"\",\"On October 8, 2015, Zack sponsored the Sports Integrity Protection Amendment (SIPA) in California to get us off the wrong path and onto the right one. \\\"This is how I see it... leagues will now end up spending money, time and effort to defend themselves in court. Their investment in DraftKings and FanDuel along with the companies themselves will go down the same drain. For a little bit of \'fan engagement,\' you get the cancer of gambling on sports, addiction issues and unsolvable integrity problems. As if that wasn\'t enough, you get sued in court for racketeering and your reputation takes a hit. I\'m an old-fashioned straight-up guy when it comes to sports. Sports inspire us to be more, to try harder, to work together, to believe we can and to turn dreams into reality. It should stay that way. SIPA creates a thriving regulated marketplace for sports trading that will benefit the fans, the players, the leagues, and the state of California. This is a win-win for everyone.\\\"\",\"Bernie Nicholls agrees. \\\"Being drafted by the Los Angeles Kings and having called California home for over a decade, I have a real soft spot for the people and the state. To think I can be a part of SIPA and help work to create a new economy for the state is an absolute honor. I believe California should be the home of the World\'s First Sports Stock Market and I will do what I can to rally the public and get the support we need to make SIPA a reality.\\\"\",\"Subscribe at http://TheSportsVote.com/ and tell us what you think.\",\"Contact:\",\"Jason Henry - The Sports Vote Media RelationsiPhone (705) 772-7066 or Email \",\" \",\" \",\"Video - http://youtu.be/oXILE1waAOc Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151123/290259 Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151123/290258 \"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"yes\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-23 21:58:16','2015-11-23 21:58:16',NULL),(10359,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/friendly-planet-travel-offers-cyber-monday-deals-300183509.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-23 15:54:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 15:54:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/friendly-planet-travel-offers-cyber-monday-deals-300183509.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/friendly-planet-travel-offers-cyber-monday-deals-300183509.html\"],\"description\":\"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --&#160;This Cyber Monday,&#160;global tour operator Friendly Planet Travel is offering travelers a savings of up to $1100 off all small group, air inclusive tours to over 35 countries, including Cuba, Myanmar, Patagonia, Greece, South Africa and a brand new \",\"content\":\"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --&#160;This Cyber Monday,&#160;global tour operator Friendly Planet Travel is offering travelers a savings of up to $1100 off all small group, air inclusive tours to over 35 countries, including Cuba, Myanmar, Patagonia, Greece, South Africa and a brand new \",\"title\":\"Friendly Planet Travel Offers Cyber Monday Deals\",\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[],\"copy\":[\"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- This Cyber Monday, global tour operator Friendly Planet Travel is offering travelers a savings of up to $1100 off all small group, air inclusive tours to over 35 countries, including Cuba, Myanmar, Patagonia, Greece, South Africa and a brand new tour to the Galapagos.\",\"Travelers will experience the beauty and incredible wildlife of the Galapagos Islands with the new Galapagos Adventure tour.

Speaking at the workshop, Grealish touched upon developing new ideas in the field of marketing, and said, \\\"The key difference between old and new methods of marketing is that in the past, the product was only introduced, but today, social media play a significant role in marketing, given the changes and developments which have taken place in marketing together with the science of telecommunications. Nevertheless, one should bear in mind that introducing products in today\'s world using social media is a different job, and customers\' needs are more difficult to meet.\",\"Unlike its traditional form, marketing today is a trend which depends on how active an individual is in social media.

Despite of the US$3.4 million in foreign exchange loss as a result of the RMB depreciation, we still delivered a record non-GAAP profit of US$15.2 million.\\\"  \",\"\\\"In the third quarter, both IT and non-IT courses kept strong growth momentum. Total student enrollments for the eleven IT courses grew by 32% year-over-year while enrollments for the three non-IT courses grew by 46% year-over-year. As a result, the composition between the IT and non-IT courses in terms of total student enrollments in the third quarter were about 59% vs. 41%,\\\" Mr. Han continued. \",\"\\\"More recently, we also launched two new courses in computer programming and digital arts for primary to high school students aged between 8 and 18 under the brand name of Tongcheng and Tongmei, respectively. This is another exciting initiative to leverage our core competency and resources to expand our course offerings. We believe that, together with our online learning platform, TMOOC.CN, which currently already has a registered user base of over 140,000, Tongcheng and Tongmei have further extended our target customer base and will bring additional growth opportunities for our company,\\\" Mr. Han concluded.  \",\"Mr. Suhai Ji, Tarena\'s Chief Financial Officer, added, \\\"although we did not add new learning centers in the third quarter on a net basis, we increased our seat capacity by 31% year-over-year mostly through enlarging the existing centers. With the center utilization rate at 80% in the third quarter, we achieved an all-time high gross margin of 75.3%, an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. We are also pleased to see our non-GAAP operating margin to be back at the level of 27%, an increase of more than 20 percentage points on a sequential basis, and the strong operating cash flow of US$23.8 million in the third quarter. The continued strong student enrollment is expected to largely offset the impact on our reported revenue figures in US dollars from the RMB depreciation, and we have further revised our revenue guidance upwards to reflect such positive trends.\\\" \",\"Third Quarter 2015 Results\",\"Net Revenues\",\"Net revenues increased by 48.2% to US$59.7 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$40.3 million in the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased course enrollments.\",\"Total course enrollments in the third quarter of 2015 increased by 43.1% to 23,912 from 16,710 in the same period in 2014, which was driven mainly by the number and the popularity of our course offerings. The number of our course offerings increased from 11 to 14 in the third quarter year-over-year while the total seat capacity in our learning centers increased by 31.0% from 31,730 as of September 30, 2014 to 41,557 as of September 30, 2015, to cater to the increased demand for our courses. \",\"In March 2015, we raised the standard tuition fees on most of our courses by RMB1,000 per course to RMB17,800.We charge students enrolled through the retail channel our standard tuition fee and provide students enrolled through the university channel a discount of approximately RMB4,000 per person per course. Our student enrollment mix from retail and university channel was 86%/14% and 81%/19% in the third quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively.\",\"Cost of Revenues\",\"Cost of revenues increased by 41.1% to US$14.8 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$10.5 million in the same period in 2014. The increase was mainly due to higher personnel cost and welfare expenses resulting from increased number of teaching and advisory staff at our learning centers and higher average salary, higher rental cost resulting from increased seat capacity, as well as higher depreciation expenses for our learning centers.\",\"Gross Profit and Gross Margin\",\"Gross profit increased by 50.7% to US$44.9 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$29.8 million in the same period in 2014.

The improvement in gross margin was mainly due to increased operational scale and efficiency for our learning centers. Our overall center utilization rate in the third quarter of 2015 increased to 80% from 77% in the same period in 2014.\",\"Operating Expenses\",\"Total operating expenses increased by 50.9% to US$30.2 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$20.0 million in the same period in 2014. Total non-GAAP operating expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 52.9% to US$28.8 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$18.9 million in the same period in 2014. Total share-based compensation expenses allocated to the related operating expenses increased by 17.9% to US$1.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$1.1 million in the same period in 2014.\",\"Selling and marketing expenses increased by 45.1% to US$16.1 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$11.1 million in the same period in 2014. The increase was due to higher personnel cost and welfare expenses related to the growth in our selling and marketing headcount and higher average salary, and expanded marketing efforts primarily as a result of increased spending on advertising as we expanded our course offerings and network of learning centers.\",\"General and administrative expenses increased by 56.5% to US$11.9 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$7.6 million in the same period in 2014. The increase was mainly due to higher compensation cost for our increased number of general and administrative personnel to support our growing operations, higher bad debt allowance and higher share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 64.8% to US$10.7 million, from US$6.5 million in the same period in 2014. \",\"Research and development expenses increased by 67.4% to US$2.1 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$1.3 million in the same period in 2014.

Non-GAAP operating income, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 47.3% to US$16.1 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$11.0 million in the same period in 2014. Non-GAAP operating margin remained relatively stable at 27.0% in the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 27.2% in the same period in 2014.\",\"Interest Income, Net\",\"Net interest income was US$2.1 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to US$1.4 million in the same period in 2014. Interest income in both periods consisted of interest earned on our cash and time deposits in commercial banks and interest income recognized in relation to our installment payment plan for students. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher tuition interest income in relation to our installment payment plan for students.\",\"Foreign Exchange Loss\",\"Foreign exchange loss was US$3.4 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to almost nil in the same period in 2014. The loss was attributable to the depreciation of China\'s RMB against U.S. dollar as a significant portion of the Company\'s IPO proceeds in April 2014 had been converted into RMB and placed in bank deposits.\",\"Income Tax Expense\",\"Income tax expense was US$0.3 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to US$1.1 million in the same period in 2014. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the effective income tax rate to 1.8% in the third quarter of 2015 from 9.6% in the same period in 2014, partially offset by higher taxable income. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a tax holiday enjoyed by one of our wholly owned subsidiaries that is qualified as a \\\"Newly Established Software Enterprise\\\" under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which provides a two-year full exemption from enterprise income tax from 2014 to 2015 followed by a three-year 50% exemption from 2016 to 2018.\",\"Net Income\",\"As a result of the foregoing, net income increased by 32.4% to US$13.8 million in the third quarter of 2015, from US$10.5 million in the same period in 2014.

Capital expenditures for the quarter were US$5.5 million.\",\"Shares Issued and Outstanding\",\"As of September 30, 2015, the Company had 43,857,802 Class A and 10,574,896 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. Each ADS represents one Class A ordinary share.\",\"Progress on Share Repurchase Plan\",\"On August 20, 2015, the Company announced that its board of directors has authorized a share repurchase plan under which the Company may repurchase up to US$20 million of its shares over the next 12 months.

Bladder cancer is actually very common, yet, most people don\'t know much about this disease that affects nearly 70,000 people every year. \",\"\\\"The majority of bladder cancer cases develop in individuals over the age of 55 and we know that cigarette smoking is one of the leading risk factors for this disease,\\\" states Rian Dickstein, M.D., Chesapeake Urology urologic oncologist and bladder cancer specialist. \\\"We also know that when bladder cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it is highly treatable, which is why it\'s so important for people to know the early warning signs of this disease and seek treatment by an experienced urologist.\\\" \",\"Facts About Bladder Cancer\",\"Bladder Cancer Symptoms\",\"Early stages of bladder cancer often produce no symptoms. Early warning signs may be hematuria (blood in your urine that may be visible or only seen under a microscope). Other less common symptoms include:\",\"These symptoms, however, may indicate other medical problems, such as urinary tract infections, bladder stones or prostate disorders, which is why a thorough evaluation by a urologist is so important.\",\"New Diagnostic Techniques Enhance Visualization of Bladder Tumors\",\"Early diagnosis of bladder cancer is key to improving patient survival rates from this disease.

In partnership with the National Turkey Federation, this year\'s Nicholas White turkeys have been raised for the past four months in California\'s Central Valley by family-owned poultry producer Foster Farms. The birds arrived at SFO via Presidential Turkey motorcade accompanied by the official Presidential Turkey entourage, including handlers and private security detail.  \",\"Late last week, the yet-to-be-named Presidential Turkeys were selected in a final review at Foster Farms\' Presidential Turkey Ranch near Modesto, California, where 20 finalists strutted their stuff for the coveted title of National Thanksgiving Turkey. The turkeys were evaluated and selected by the Chairman of the National Turkey Federation, Dr. Jihad Douglas, and Foster Farms turkey grower and third generation turkey farmer, Joe Hedden. A fifth grade class from Eisenhut Elementary in Modesto attended to cheer-on their favorite choice. The White House will officially name the birds based on suggestions that included hundreds of submissions from California schoolchildren. \",\"\\\"We wanted a proud bird, fit to meet the president,\\\" said Hedden. \\\"We chose this year\'s birds based on superior plumage, posture, personality, sociability and manners. Our team worked to socialize the birds as they grew to prepare for the big day at the White House, which included playing music to acclimate to noise and teaching them to sit calmly on a table. This year\'s turkeys are country music fans.\\\"\",\"\\\"The annual presentation of the National Thanksgiving Turkey is an important tradition that pays tribute to Thanksgiving and recognizes the turkey industry\'s role in the national holiday,\\\" said Ira Brill, Foster Farms director of communications and Unofficial Presidential Turkey Historian. \\\"Foster Farms is honored to raise the National Thanksgiving Turkey for the second time in five years and highlight the significant role of California agriculture in the national landscape.\\\" \",\"Representing the Nicholas White, a breed originating in California\'s Sonoma Valley, this year\'s National Thanksgiving Turkey boasts bold, patriotic red and white coloration. Although these birds will meet the President of the United States, they are raised no differently than all Foster Farms turkeys, and live comfortably in a barn where they are misted and fanned. \",\"Following the pardoning ceremony, the Presidential Turkey and its alternate will live out their days at Morven Park\'s Turkey Hill in Leesburg, Virginia. The remaining presidential flock will continue their lives at Foster Farms\' Presidential Turkey Ranch. \",\"Learn more about the Presidential Turkey pardoning ceremony and this year\'s turkeys at www.presidentialturkey.com. \",\"About Foster Farms     Since 1939, West Coast families have depended on Foster Farms for premium quality chicken and turkey products.

Honda presentó su Ridgeline de primera generación en 2005 como un modelo 2006. La Ridgeline desafió el pensamiento convencional en diseño de camionetas pick-up con su diseño de plataforma de caja cerrada creada sobre una sola pieza, ofreciendo superior dinámica de manejo, eficiencia de combustible y espacio interior, junto con sus capacidades medianas en remolque, carga y todoterreno. También introdujo varias características pioneras en la industria, incluso una puerta trasera de doble acción y el maletero cama que se puede cerrar con llave. La Ridgeline obtuvo el premio Camioneta Norteamericana del Año, edición 2006 y Camioneta del Año edición 2008 de la revista Motor Trend, y estuvo a la cabeza de todas las otras pick-ups medianas en el estudio APEAL de J.D. Power durante tres años consecutivos.\",\"Como el original, la Ridgeline de próxima generación está siendo diseñada y desarrollada por Honda Manufacturing of Alabama en Lincoln, Alabama.  La nueva Ridgeline se unirá a una ampliada línea de camionetas livianas de Honda que incluye la crossover subcompacta HR-V 2016 totalmente nueva, la siempre popular Honda CR-V, el SUV mejor vendido de Estados Unidos, y la 2016 Honda Pilot rediseñada, que disputa el premio Camioneta Norteamericana del Año, edición 2016.  A la Ridgeline le seguirá el lanzamiento de una minivan Odyssey totalmente renovada en la segunda mitad del año próximo. Todas las camionetas livianas de Honda son fabricadas en América del Norte, y todas menos la HR-V son fabricadas exclusivamente en EE. UU., en las plantas de Honda en Ohio y Alabama, con repuestos locales e internacionales.\",\"Historia de las carreras de Honda en Baja\",\"Honda tiene una larga historia de éxitos en las carreras de motos en Baja, con dos docenas de victorias, incluso 17 victorias consecutivas en SCORE Baja 1000 hasta el año 2013. Honda entró en la competencia SCORE de cuatro ruedas en la península Baja en 2005, compitiendo en la clase Stock Mini con una Honda Ridgeline al volante de Clive Skilton y su organización California Race and Rally (Carr).  El piloto Gavin Skilton y la Ridgeline lograron su primera victoria en SCORE Baja 1000 en 2008, mientras Gavin y el copiloto Andy Grader lograron una segunda victoria en la clase Stock Mini en la SCORE Baja 1000, edición 2010. Ambas victorias se lograron en sociedad con HPD.  Subiendo a la categoría Class Six Trophy Truck en 2012 con un Desert Pilot tubular de HPD desarrollado conjuntamente por HPD y Carr, Skilton ganó la categoría en Score Baja 500 en junio, luego se asoció con el hermano Darren Skilton para terminar en tercer lugar en la SCORE Baja 1000 de ese año.\",\"Desarrollo de rendimiento de Honda  \",\"HPD fue fundada en 1993 para encabezar el ingreso de Honda a las carreras de autos de Indy.  Ningún otro fabricante ha logrado igualar el éxito de Honda en automóviles de Indy, que incluye 212 victorias en carreras, 15 títulos de pilotos, seis títulos de fabricantes y 10 victorias en la Indianápolis 500, incluido el evento del año 2014 ganado por Ryan Hunter-Reay de Andriette Auto sport. \",\"Las iniciativas de carreras de prototipos de HPD han dado como resultado más de 70 victorias y múltiples campeonatos American Le Mans Series.  El debut en carreras de automóviles deportivos de la compañía en el año 2007 en las 12 Horas de Sabering marcó el primer triunfo del motor LEM-V de HPD y el primero para un motor de carrera de Honda diseñado y desarrollado fuera de Japón.\",\"HPD ganó el título LAMP en el Campeonato Mundial de Enduro inaugural del año 2012 y ganó dos veces la categoría LAMP en las 24 Horas de Le Mans desde el 2010. \",\"HPD ofrece una línea completa de motores de carrera para automóviles, desde el nivel básico hasta lo más excelso; para pilotos profesionales, aficionados y principiantes.  Para más información acerca de HPD y las líneas de productos de carreras de la compañía, visite http://hpd.honda.com.\",\"Foto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151122/290041\",\"Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140312/LA82397LOGO-a\"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"yes\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-23 23:14:16','2015-11-23 23:14:16',NULL),(10494,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boca-groves-1st-annual-give-back-to-the-community-300183608.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-23 18:06:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 18:06:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boca-groves-1st-annual-give-back-to-the-community-300183608.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boca-groves-1st-annual-give-back-to-the-community-300183608.html\"],\"description\":\"BOCA RATON, Fla., Nov. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Boca Grove Golf and Tennis Club teamed up with Meals on Wheels of the Palm Beaches to help support their \\\"Pie It Forward\\\" inaugural campaign during this Thanksgiving Holiday.\\n\\n\\nThe members of Boca Grove helped Executive Chef Dominic Laudia and his team\",\"content\":\"BOCA RATON, Fla., Nov. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Boca Grove Golf and Tennis Club teamed up with Meals on Wheels of the Palm Beaches to help support their \\\"Pie It Forward\\\" inaugural campaign during this Thanksgiving Holiday.\\n\\n\\nThe members of Boca Grove helped Executive Chef Dominic Laudia and his team\",\"title\":\"Boca Grove\'s 1st Annual Give Back to the Community\",\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[],\"copy\":[\"BOCA RATON, Fla., Nov. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Boca Grove Golf and Tennis Club teamed up with Meals on Wheels of the Palm Beaches to help support their \\\"Pie It Forward\\\" inaugural campaign during this Thanksgiving Holiday.\",\"The members of Boca Grove helped Executive Chef Dominic Laudia and his team bake 100 pecan pies to be delivered to the community this week.

Solid nodules are dense, and they obscure adjacent tissue, while subsolid nodules are divided into two different types: part solid (nodules with both a solid component and a ground-glass, or hazy area), and pure ground glass, which are devoid of solid elements. Nodule consistency is considered an indicator of lung cancer risk, with part solid nodules being most strongly associated with lung cancer in the screening setting.\",\"\\\"We know there are differences in cancer risk among different lung nodule consistencies, but we were unaware of any published reports that looked at the differences in lung cancer risk for nodule subtypes between women and men,\\\" said study lead author Phillip Boiselle, M.D., from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Mass.\",\"For the new study, Dr. Boiselle and colleagues reviewed CT scans from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large, randomized control study that demonstrated the value of CT screening in reducing lung cancer mortality. The NLST included more than 40 percent women, giving the research team a rare opportunity to look for statistically significant differences in lung nodules and lung cancer between the sexes. \",\"The researchers characterized all CT-detected nodules measuring 4 to 30 millimeters by consistency using the NLST database and calculated the relative risk of developing a lung cancer for each nodule consistency subtype. \",\"Out of 26,455 participants, 9,994, or 37.8 percent, had a positive screen at one or more points during the trial. Women with ground-glass nodules had a significantly higher relative risk of lung cancer than men with the same type of nodules, and a similar trend was observed for part-solid nodules. In contrast, the relative risk of lung cancer for solid nodules was comparable for both sexes. \",\"Part-solid nodules had the highest predictive value of cancer in both sexes, whereas solid nodules had the lowest predictive value in women and ground glass nodules had the lowest predictive value in men. \",\"\\\"The main difference we found was that women were 50 percent more likely than men to have ground-glass nodules and, when these nodules were present, women had a substantially higher risk of developing lung cancer,\\\" Dr. Boiselle said. \",\"Current lung cancer screening guidelines do not take into account gender differences when managing nodules of different consistencies. While more research is needed before changes are made to clinical practice, the results suggest that women with ground glass nodules may need closer follow-up than men. \",\"\\\"By looking at the rate at which lung cancers grow on serial CT scans, we can develop a better understanding of how often to obtain follow-up CT scans in men and women,\\\" Dr. Boiselle said.\",\"The researchers plan to continue studying the NLST data to further understand the significance of these cancers, especially with respect to their influence on lung cancer mortality.\",\"Co-authors on the study are Fenghai Duan, Ph.D., Stavroula Chysanthopoulou, Ph.D., Sarah DeMello, M.S., Denise R.

The findings suggest that arterial imaging with 3-D MRI could be useful in helping to determine stroke risk among diabetics.\",\"The carotid arteries are vessels on each side of the neck that supply oxygenated blood to the head. Narrowing of the carotid arteries is associated with risk of stroke, but less is known about stroke risk in people with little or no narrowing of these arteries. \",\"For the new study, researchers used 3-D MRI to study the carotid arteries for evidence of intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), an indicator of advanced atherosclerotic disease.\",\"\\\"A recent analysis of multiple studies has shown that people with carotid artery narrowing and IPH have a five- to six-times higher risk of stroke in the near future compared to people without,\\\" said study author Tishan Maraj, M.B.B.S., imaging analyst at Sunnybrook Research Institute and M.Sc. candidate at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada.\",\"Dr. Maraj and colleagues focused their study on people with diabetes, a group already facing a significantly increased risk of strokes with worse outcomes than the non-diabetic population. They used 3-D MRI to investigate the prevalence of carotid IPH in 159 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients, average age 63, recruited from a dietary trial between 2010 and 2013. \",\"Of the 159 patients imaged, 37, or 23.3 percent, had IPH in at least one carotid artery. Five of the 37 patients had IPH in both carotid arteries. IPH was found in the absence of carotid artery stenosis, or narrowing, and was associated with an increased carotid artery wall volume as measured by 3-D MRI.\",\"\\\"It was surprising that so many diabetic patients had this feature,\\\" Dr. Maraj said. \\\"We already knew that people with diabetes face three to five times the risk of stroke, so perhaps IPH is an early indicator of stroke risk that should be followed up.\\\"\",\"While 2-D MRI has been used for more than a decade to identify and characterize carotid artery plaques, the 3-D method brings an extra level of imaging power, Dr. Maraj noted.\",\"\\\"The advantage of 3-D MRI is you can image the entire carotid artery and pinpoint the area of interest over a shorter period of time compared with multiple 2-D sequences,\\\" he said.\",\"Dr. Maraj emphasized that the study did not look at outcomes for the patients and did not draw any conclusions on whether people with IPH will develop carotid artery blockages more quickly than those with no IPH present. However, it is already known that blood is a destabilizing factor of plaque that promotes rupture, setting off a chain of events that can lead to a stroke. \",\"Although there is no treatment for IPH at this time, Dr. Maraj said identification of it may help with risk stratification and could even have applications in the non-diabetic population.\",\"\\\"Even though you can\'t treat IPH, you can monitor patients a lot more closely,\\\" he said.\",\"Co-authors on the study are Alan R.

(CTI BioPharma or the Company) (NASDAQ and MTA: CTIC) today announced that the United Kingdom\'s National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Haematological Oncology Clinical Studies Group has chosen to advance tosedostat, the Company\'s investigative oral aminopeptidase inhibitor, to the second stage of a randomized clinical trial of low-dose cytarabine plus or minus tosedostat in older patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). The AML Less Intensive (LI-1) trial is designed as a \\\"Pick-a-Winner\\\" trial to be able to simultaneously test a number of promising agents added to standard therapy with low-dose cytarabine in older patients with AML or MDS who are unfit for standard aggressive induction therapy. Nine regimens have been tested in the Pick-a-Winner program, of which only 4, including tosedostat, have passed the initial hurdle for progression (which requires evidence of an improvement in remission rate with acceptable safety). The ultimate aim of the trial is to identify treatments that can double the 2-year survival of patients in this group. Based on the randomized Phase 2 interim analysis, the trial management group determined that tosedostat should proceed to the next stage of the study. It is anticipated that an additional 110 patients will be required in such phase. A further evaluation will take place before the intended expansion to a 400 patient Phase 3 trial. \",\"Tosedostat is a potential first-in-class selective inhibitor of aminopeptidases, which are enzymes required by some tumor cells, but not normal cells, to provide a source of amino acids necessary for growth and tumor cell survival.\",\"\\\"A large portion of older patients and patients with comorbid conditions are poorly suited for conventional intensive chemotherapy due to a high rate of treatment-related mortality. For these patients, there is a significant unmet need for effective and well tolerated alternative therapies,\\\" said Jack Singer, M.D., Chief Scientific Officer of CTI BioPharma. \\\"We are pleased that tosedostat has been selected to continue in this trial and is moving forward to the next stage. Tosedostat has demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in three prior Phase 2 studies in both first-line AML in older patients and in patients who relapsed following standard therapies. Tosedostat is an oral agent given once daily on an outpatient basis that has not been associated with drug-related blood count suppression.\\\" \",\"About the LI-1 TrialIn this Phase 2/3 trial, referred to as the AML Less Intensive (LI-1) trial, patients are randomized to standard treatment with low dose cytarabine, versus several investigational treatments - each usually in combination with low dose cytarabine. This is called a \\\"Pick-a-Winner\\\" trial design. Under this design, the Phase 2 portion of the trial initially randomized 50 patients per arm, and, if the complete response rate of cytarabine plus novel therapy appeared satisfactory, the randomization continues to the next stage usually with an additional 50 patients per arm. There is then a further assessment by the data monitoring committee to allow the trial to continue to the final stage in which case up to a total of approximately 200 patients per arm would be enrolled. Overall survival will serve as the primary endpoint of the trial. The NCRI Haematological Oncology Clinical Studies Group under the sponsorship of Cardiff University is conducting the trial. \",\"About TosedostatTosedostat is an oral aminopeptidase inhibitor that has demonstrated anti-tumor responses in blood-related cancers and solid tumors in Phase 1-2 clinical trials. Tosedostat is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of patients with AML or high-risk MDS. Tosedostat is not approved or commercially available.\",\"About Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. In older patients, AML may occur de novo or secondary to prior anti-cancer therapy, or from progression of other diseases, such as myelodysplasia. AML is a cancer characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age.1 The symptoms of AML are caused by the replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells, leading to infections and bleeding. AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated. In 2015, approximately 20,830 new cases of AML are expected to be diagnosed in the United States and an estimated 10,460 are expected to die from the disease.2 While AML may occur at any age, adults at least 60 years of age are more likely than younger people to develop the disease.2 Although a substantial proportion of younger individuals who develop AML can be cured, AML in the elderly typically responds poorly to standard therapy with few complete remissions. \",\"AML may develop from the progression of other diseases, such as MDS. MDS are a group of diverse bone marrow disorders in which the bone marrow does not produce enough healthy blood cells. MDS is often referred to as a \\\"bone marrow failure disorder.\\\"\",\"About CTI BioPharma CTI BioPharma Corp.

The report includes a geographical segmentation of the market to cover regions such as APAC, EMEA, and Americas. It also covers the landscape of the global electric high performance vehicle market platform, and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\",\"The focus of manufacturers has shifted to the development of Li-ion batteries with extended life. Lithium has the highest electrochemical potential of all metals. Li-ion batteries have replaced lead-acid batteries in a variety of applications, such as laptops, cellphones, medical devices, electric bikes, UPS systems, tablets, and electric scooters. \",\"According to the report, EHPVs have lower operating costs than conventional liquid fuel-powered ICE vehicles. In the US, the operating cost of EHPVs is less than one-fourth that of gasoline-driven vehicles. In countries with high fuel prices, the operating cost of EHPVs is even lower. EHPVs are fuel-efficient and allow for less frequent changing spark plugs, oil and oil filters, and other vehicle components.\",\"Further, the report states that EHPVs have high initial costs compared to those of conventional diesel or gasoline-based vehicles. However, manufacturers are planning to increase their production of EHPVs by implementing the concept of economies of scale to reduce manufacturing costs. This is being done with the expectation that the cost benefits enjoyed by manufacturers will eventually be transferred to consumers. However, EHPVs currently face intense competition from gasoline-based vehicles due to their initial costs and total cost of ownership.\",\"Key vendors \",\"Other prominent vendors \",\"For more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cl96l2/global_automotive\",\"\\n\",\"Media Contact:\\nLaura Wood\\n+353-1-481-1716\\npress@researchandmarkets.net\\n\"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"yes\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-24 07:07:57','2015-11-24 07:07:57',NULL),(10632,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-and-chinese-ndfeb-industry-report-2015-2018---china-is-the-worlds-largest-ndfeb-producer-with-an-output-of-112-kt-in-2014-881-of-the-global-total-up-190-year-on-year-553126161.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-24 02:00:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 02:00:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-and-chinese-ndfeb-industry-report-2015-2018---china-is-the-worlds-largest-ndfeb-producer-with-an-output-of-112-kt-in-2014-881-of-the-global-total-up-190-year-on-year-553126161.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-and-chinese-ndfeb-industry-report-2015-2018---china-is-the-worlds-largest-ndfeb-producer-with-an-output-of-112-kt-in-2014-881-of-the-global-total-up-190-year-on-year-553126161.html\"],\"description\":\"DUBLIN, November 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\\n\\nResearch and Markets&#160;(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/wzdlp6/global_and) has announced the addition of the&#160;\\\"Global and Chinese NdFeB Industry Report, 2015-2018\\\" &#160;report to their offering.&#160;\\n\\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (Logo: http\",\"content\":\"DUBLIN, November 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\\n\\nResearch and Markets&#160;(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/wzdlp6/global_and) has announced the addition of the&#160;\\\"Global and Chinese NdFeB Industry Report, 2015-2018\\\" &#160;report to their offering.&#160;\\n\\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (Logo: http\",\"title\":\"Global and Chinese NdFeB Industry Report 2015-2018 - China is the World\'s Largest NdFeB Producer With an Output of 112 kt in 2014 (88.1% of the Global Total), up 19.0% Year on Year\",\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[],\"copy\":[\"DUBLIN, November 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\",\"Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/wzdlp6/global_and) has announced the addition of the \\\"Global and Chinese NdFeB Industry Report, 2015-2018\\\"  report to their offering. \",\"     (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130307/600769)\\n\",\"China is the world\'s largest NdFeB producer with an output of 112 kt in 2014 (88.1% of the global total), up 19.0% year on year.

The global screw pumps market is projected to grow significantly, posting a CAGR of over 7%, which is triggered by rapid urbanization and industrialization. Moreover, increase in urbanization has resulted in rising demand for improved infrastructure and water and wastewater treatment plants, thus expediting the demand for screw pumps. \\n\\nIndustrial growth in developing countries such as China and India are motivating global players to establish their manufacturing facilities in these countries, hence fueling the demand for screw pumps. Additionally, some enterprises are leveraging from the benefits of rotary positive displacement screw pumps for transporting crude oil. One primary reason behind the rising popularity of screw pumps is that they incur low maintenance. \\n\\nSegmentation of the global screw pumps market by end-user \",\"The oil and gas industry contributes the largest market share with more than 25% share, as this industry deploys screw pumps for spanning oil exploration, drilling, pumping oil to surface, wellbore recovery, and processing application in oil refineries and petrochemical plants. Thus, increasing oil production play an important role in boosting the market growth during the forecast period. \\n\\nAsia contributes the majority share to the market revenue and also registers the highest growth rate of more than 8% by 2019.

This is something that many doctors, scientists, and public health experts have been pushing for a long time. One questions remains: with fewer PSA tests being done, will there be more men dying of prostate cancer? \",\"According to Dr. David Samadi, \\\"Despite the efforts made in regards to early detection for prostate cancer, the disease remains the second leading cancer cause of death in men, killing approximately 27,500 men this year. Tens of thousands of additional men suffer from the burden of painful metastatic prostate cancer, which can lead to bone fractures, the inability to urinate, spinal cord compression and renal failure. The evidence remains that since PSA screening became widely recognized in the early 1990\'s, there has been a 39 percent reduction in prostate cancer mortality rates.\\\"\",\"However, not everyone agrees with his finding. Others say that fewer PSA tests will not cause more prostate cancer deaths. According to Dr. Kenneth Lin, a family medicine physician at Georgetown University School of Medicine, the claim that fewer PSA tests will cause more prostate cancer deaths is based on \\\"putting all your faith\\\" on a European study that found a mortality benefit from PSA screening. Dr, Lin said \\\"It\'s not right to ignore the other trials,\\\" which he claims did not show the PSA blood test saves men\'s lives. \",\"There has been controversy over PSA screening for a number of years. The evidence began piling up about a decade ago that the PSA test leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. It is true that an elevated PSA may indicate prostate cancer. However, the PSA is not specific for prostate cancer and could also indicate other prostate related conditions. Many argue that prostate cancers are so slow growing that they may never even put a man\'s health or life at risk, and that many men with prostate cancer will die with it, not of it. \",\"The PSA test is not perfect, and there are a few new blood tests being developed to replace the PSA test such as the 4KScore and the PHI test, both of which are prostate cancer. In the meantime, rather than getting rid of PSA screening, there are other things that can be done to optimize the benefit of the PSA test while reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. It is important that that PSA test not be looked at as a single test result. Physicians must also take into account the PSA trends, co-morbid conditions, overall life expectancy, and understand patients\' treatment goals.\",\"According to Dr. Samadi, \\\"The controversy over PSA screening exposes the importance of the need for physicians to put more emphasis on treating their patients as individuals, and not just as a population. Because the PSA test is not always the best measurement for all patients, the decisions made for diagnosing and treating each patient should be based on the individual. Until then, and until we have a better test for diagnosis prostate cancer, it is simply too dangerous to tell men to stop having PSA tests.\\\"\",\"Patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer can contact world renowned prostate cancer surgeon and urologic oncologist, Dr. David Samadi, for a free phone consultation and to learn more about PSA screening.

In the Growth Factor studies recently published by the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, patients with arm bruising were studied over the course of 6 weeks applying Growth Factors morning and night. Subjects who followed this regimen saw diminished appearance of bruising as the skin thickened. In a second study, Growth Factors were used twice daily on patients suffering from sagging under-eye bags over the course of 12 weeks. Subjects who followed the regimen saw a 75% or more improvement of the appearance of under-eye bags. Furthermore, both studies report that Growth Factors are effective in thickening of the skin which leads to tightening of the skin when bruising is present, and improving the appearance of under-eye bags. \",\"Additional to the Regeneration Serum, DNAEGF Renewal offers a complete line of skincare including a Foaming Cleansing Gel, Intensive Renewal Lightweight Moisturizer, Night Renewal Moisturizer, Eye Renewal Serum, and Scar Therapy.

With over 25 years of specializing in skin care, skin cancer, and skin cancer research, Dr. Moy is passionate about skin health. As national skin cancer rates have risen over the years, it became clear to Dr. Moy that sunscreen alone is not enough to prevent it, and began to research other ways to help his patients. After reading studies from the National Institute of Health (NIH) about the success of DNA Repair Enzymes in helping to repair damaged DNA, Dr. Moy began to formulate DNAEGF Renewal products in order to help reduce skin cancer rates and improve overall skin health with effective and clean ingredients. Instagram / twitter: @dnarenewal\",\" \"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"no\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-24 11:56:35','2015-11-24 11:56:35',NULL),(10807,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nicb-releases-annual-holiday-vehicle-theft-report-300182569.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-24 06:00:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 06:00:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nicb-releases-annual-holiday-vehicle-theft-report-300182569.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nicb-releases-annual-holiday-vehicle-theft-report-300182569.html\"],\"description\":\"DES PLAINES, Ill., Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --&#160;Holiday car thieves had their busiest day in 2014 on, ironically, Labor Day, stealing 2,200 vehicles according to new data released today by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB).&#160; NICB\'s 2014 Annual Holiday Vehicle Theft Report analyze\",\"content\":\"DES PLAINES, Ill., Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --&#160;Holiday car thieves had their busiest day in 2014 on, ironically, Labor Day, stealing 2,200 vehicles according to new data released today by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB).&#160; NICB\'s 2014 Annual Holiday Vehicle Theft Report analyze\",\"title\":\"NICB Releases Annual Holiday Vehicle Theft Report\",\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[],\"copy\":[],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"neutral\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-24 11:56:36','2015-11-24 11:56:36',NULL),(10808,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magal-security-systems-reports-third-quarter-2015-financial-results-300183845.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-24 06:02:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 06:02:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magal-security-systems-reports-third-quarter-2015-financial-results-300183845.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magal-security-systems-reports-third-quarter-2015-financial-results-300183845.html\"],\"description\":\"YEHUD, Israel, Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --&#160;Magal Security Systems, Ltd.

Highlights include:\",\"\\\"We are successfully executing on our strategy and we are pleased to report another year of excellent performance, both in terms of serving our customers and delivering earnings growth. We accomplished this through our organic growth initiatives, including prudent infrastructure upgrades, while integrating Missouri Gas Energy and Alagasco,\\\" said Suzanne Sitherwood, president and chief executive officer.  \\\"On the strength of this performance and our expected growth in 2016, our board of directors raised Laclede\'s dividend by 6.5 percent to an annualized rate of $1.96, marking our 13th consecutive year of higher dividends and our 71st year of continuous dividend payments,\\\" Sitherwood added.\",\"For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, Laclede reported NEE of $138.3 million, up from $100.1 million for fiscal 2014.  Consolidated net income for fiscal 2015 was $136.9 million up from $84.6 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by significantly higher Gas Utility segment earnings due to the addition of Alagasco and growth in the Missouri Utilities, partially offset by lower Gas Marketing earnings and higher non-utility expenses.  On a per-share basis, NEE was $3.19 per diluted share for fiscal 2015, compared to $3.05 per share in the prior-year period, which included a benefit of $0.17 per share in Gas Marketing due to unusually cold weather.  Adjusting for the weather benefit in 2014, NEE per share was up 11 percent in 2015 over the prior year.  Per share results for 2015 reflect the weighted average impact of 10.4 million common shares issued in mid-2014 to finance a portion of the Alagasco acquisition.\",\"Gas Utility\",\"The Gas Utility segment comprises the regulated gas distribution operations of Laclede Gas and Alagasco.  Laclede Gas serves St. Louis and eastern Missouri and, through Missouri Gas Energy (MGE), Kansas City and western Missouri.  Alagasco serves central and northern Alabama.\",\"For fiscal 2015, the Gas Utility segment reported NEE of $150.4 million, up 62 percent from $92.8 million for 2014. Net income was $153.3 million, up from $87.1 million a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to a $271.3 million improvement in operating margin (non-GAAP; see \\\"Operating Margin and Reconciliation to GAAP\\\"), of which $270.3 million is attributable to the addition of Alagasco. The remaining increase in margin in the Missouri Utilities was the result of higher Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS) and base rate revenues, and modest customer growth. This increase was partially offset by lower sales volumes and asset optimization margins reflecting the return of more normal weather after the record cold winter of 2014.  Other operating expenses increased by $112.1 million, or $119.7 million after removing a $7.6 million non-recurring gain on sale of property in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, with $134.4 million of the increase related to the addition of Alagasco. This was offset in part by lower operating and maintenance costs for the Missouri Utilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $47.5 million, with $43.4 million attributable to Alagasco and the remainder reflecting higher capital investments.\",\"Gas Marketing\",\"The Gas Marketing segment includes the results of Laclede Energy Resources (LER), which provides non-regulated natural gas marketing services to the Midwest region. Gas Marketing NEE for fiscal 2015 was $4.2 million, down from $10.2 million a year ago. Net income decreased to $4.1 million from $12.2 million.  Operating margin in the current year declined by $13.3 million as a result of market conditions and the expiration of a favorable supply contract in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Prior year market conditions were impacted by the extreme cold weather in the Midwest, resulting in higher price volatility and wider seasonal and regional price differentials.  In 2015, markets returned to more normal pricing and volatility levels, due in large part to expanding natural gas supply.\",\"Other\",\"Laclede\'s other non-utility operations and corporate costs, on a net economic earnings basis, were higher by $13.4 million in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, reflecting $16.6 million in higher interest expense related to debt issued in 2014 to finance the Alagasco acquisition.  On a GAAP basis, the net loss was $5.8 million larger year-over-year reflecting the higher interest expense, partially offset by lower transaction and integration expenses.\",\"QUARTERLY RESULTS\",\"Laclede\'s Gas Utility business is seasonal in nature, with its earnings concentrated during the winter heating season.  As a result, the Company typically reports a loss in its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30.  For the fourth quarter of 2015, Laclede reported a net economic loss of $16.1 million ($0.37 per share) compared to $2.4 million ($0.07 per share) in the prior year period.  Consolidated net loss for the fourth quarter was $18.7 million in 2015 compared to a net loss of $14.9 million a year ago.  The larger loss is due primarily to the change in the Gas Utility\'s quarterly distribution of earnings reflecting the addition of Alagasco and the change to MGE\'s rate design to include a small variable usage component.  \",\"Gas Utility\",\"The Gas Utility segment reported a net economic loss of $12.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, compared to a loss of $1.0 million for the same period a year ago. Net loss for the segment was $13.2 million compared to $4.5 million in the prior year. The increase in the seasonal loss reflects higher, largely fixed costs, partially offset by an increase in operating margin. Operating margin was higher by $18.8 million with $21.8 million of the increase due to the addition of Alagasco. Margin for the Missouri Utilities decreased $3.1 million reflecting lower seasonal earnings due to the change in MGE\'s rate design, partially offset by higher ISRS revenues.\",\"Other operating expenses for the quarter of $111.5 million increased by $20.1 million, reflecting $22.9 million associated with Alagasco, offset by lower labor-related expenses and cost efficiencies achieved by the Missouri Utilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $9.3 million from last year, with $8.1 million of the increase due to the addition of Alagasco.\",\"Gas Marketing\",\"Fourth quarter fiscal 2015 net economic earnings were $1.2 million, up from $0.4 million in the prior-year period, while net income increased to $0.6 million from a prior period net loss of $0.7 million. The increase in earnings reflects expansion of LER\'s producer services business and sales to power generation markets.\",\"Other\",\"Other non-utility operations and corporate costs, on a net economic earnings basis, were $3.1 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year, reflecting the inclusion of Alagasco-related financing costs for the full quarter in 2015.  The net loss was $6.1 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $9.7 million a year ago, as acquisition and transaction-related costs were significantly lower in the current quarter versus the prior year.\",\"DIVIDEND INCREASE\",\"As a result of the strong performance in fiscal 2015, and expectations for continued growth in 2016, the board of directors of The Laclede Group increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 6.5 percent to $0.49 per share, up from $0.46 per share, raising the annualized rate to $1.96 per share.  This compares with an increase in the prior year of 4.5 percent. The Laclede Group has continuously paid a cash dividend since 1946, and 2016 will mark the 13th consecutive year that the annualized dividend has increased.\",\"The dividend is payable January 5, 2016, to shareholders of record on December 11, 2015.\",\"BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS\",\"Laclede maintains a strong capital structure with ample liquidity.  At fiscal year end, the Company had a balanced long-term capitalization of 50.1 percent equity and 49.9 percent debt, increasing the equity percentage by 90 basis points during fiscal 2015.  Short-term borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2015 were $338.0 million reflecting normal seasonal borrowing patterns and the Company maintains significant capacity to meet its anticipated capital needs heading into the winter heating season.\",\"During the fiscal third quarter, Alagasco refinanced $115 million of existing debt through two private placements of Senior Notes.  $35 million of ten-year Notes with a coupon of 3.21 percent funded on September 15, 2015, and $80 million of 30-year, 4.31 percent Notes will fund on December 1, 2015.\",\"Net cash provided by operating activities was $322.4 million for fiscal 2015, up from $122.6 million in 2014.  This increase of over 2.5 times includes $96.3 million from the addition of Alagasco for a full year as well as higher Missouri Utilities cash flow due to the timing of collections of gas costs under the Purchased Gas Adjustment clauses and changes in natural gas inventory values.\",\"Capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 increased to $289.8 million from $171.0 million in the prior year, reflecting $80.2 million from the addition of Alagasco combined with higher spending by the Missouri Utilities related to infrastructure upgrades, technology and facilities.  Committed capital expenditures, including accrued but unbilled capital spend, was $297 million for fiscal 2015.\",\"For additional details on Laclede\'s results for the fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2015, please see the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income, unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\",\"EARNINGS GUIDANCE AND OUTLOOK\",\"The Company is initiating earnings guidance and expects its fiscal 2016 net economic earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.34 to $3.44, a growth of 5 - 8 percent from fiscal 2015 earnings. Laclede\'s fiscal 2016 earnings guidance assumes normal weather and a continued increase in capital spending, as described below.\",\"Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $315 million, with the Gas Utilities accounting for approximately $310 million of that total.  This increase reflects the continued ramp-up of infrastructure upgrades in both Missouri and Alabama. Laclede expects that 70 percent of its fiscal 2016 capital expenditures will be recovered in rates with minimal lag under the existing regulatory mechanisms in Missouri and Alabama.  In addition, approximately 10 percent of the remaining total spend is anticipated to support Missouri-based new business expansion that will add to operating margin.\",\"Looking longer term, the Company anticipates that its level of capital spending will increase from $315 million in 2016 to approximately $335 million by 2020, or a total of more than $1.6 billion over the next five years, driven by higher utility investment.\",\"Laclede also confirms its long-term net economic earnings per share growth target of 4 - 6 percent.\",\"REGULATORY MATTERS\",\"Alagasco\",\"Under the rate-setting process in Alabama, Alagasco made its annual Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) filing with the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC) on October 30, 2015. The RSE filing presents Alagasco\'s budget for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, including net income and a calculation of return on average common equity (ROE) for the year at 10.8 percent, plus a 5 basis point adder for achieving certain customer satisfaction rankings. Alagasco\'s filing requested a $3.3 million rate reduction in order to bring its full-year return in line with its allowed ROE.  This filing is currently being reviewed by the APSC, and it is anticipated that new rates will be effective December 1, 2015.\",\"Missouri Utilities\",\"On November 12, 2015, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved increases in annual ISRS charges of $4.4 million for Laclede Gas and $1.9 million for MGE effective December 1, 2015. These increases bring the annual ISRS run rate to $19.6 million for Laclede Gas and $6.7 million for MGE.  ISRS allows for more timely regulatory recovery of investments made by gas utilities to meet state and federal safety requirements, enhance the integrity of their distribution system, or for unreimbursed relocations to facilitate public construction and development projects. The upgrades to our distribution infrastructure serve to improve safety and reliability and reduce maintenance costs.\",\"ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS\",\"The after-tax impact of acquisition-related costs, primarily for integrating MGE and Alagasco, are excluded from GAAP results for NEE purposes.  See \\\"Net Economic Earnings and Reconciliation to GAAP.\\\"\",\"For regulatory purposes, Laclede Gas defers for future rate recovery 50 percent of the one-time costs incurred for the integration of MGE. The Company has incurred integration costs for Alagasco since closing on the acquisition effective August 31, 2014. In total, acquisition-related costs reflected in the income statement for fiscal 2015 were $9.8 million, or $6.1 million after tax. In fiscal 2014 acquisition-related costs were comprised of MGE integration costs and Alagasco transaction costs.

(NYSE:  LG), headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company whose primary business is the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas service to more than 1.56 million residential, commercial and industrial customers across Missouri and Alabama. Its Gas Utility segment consists of three natural gas utilities: Laclede Gas Company (serving St. Louis and eastern Missouri), Missouri Gas Energy (serving Kansas City and western Missouri) and Alabama Gas Corporation serving central and northern Alabama, including Birmingham and Montgomery. Laclede\'s non-utility businesses include Laclede Energy Resources, Inc., providing non-regulated natural gas services, and Spire which provides compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling solutions for transportation fleets. Laclede is committed to transforming its business and pursuing growth by 1) growing its Gas Utility business through prudent pipeline replacement investment and organic growth initiatives; 2) acquiring and integrating gas utilities; 3) modernizing its gas assets, and 4) investing in innovation and emerging markets.

The Company\'s future operating results may be affected by various uncertainties and risk factors, many of which are beyond the Company\'s control, including weather conditions, economic factors, the competitive environment, governmental and regulatory policy and action, and risks associated with the acquisition and integration of MGE and Alagasco. For a more complete description of these uncertainties and risk factors, see the Company\'s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission later today.\",\"This news release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of \\\"net economic earnings,\\\" and \\\"net economic earnings per share,\\\" and \\\"operating margins.\\\" Management also uses these non-GAAP measures internally when evaluating the Company\'s performance and results of operations. Net economic earnings exclude from net income the after-tax impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions. These adjustments, which primarily impact the Gas Marketing segment, include net unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives resulting from the current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement, lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, and realized gains and losses on economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity. In calculating net economic earnings, management also excludes from net income the after-tax impacts related to acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring activities, including one-time costs related to the integration of MGE and Alagasco.  Management believes that excluding these items provides a useful representation of the economic impact of actual settled transactions and overall results of ongoing operations. Operating margin adjusts operating income to include only those costs that are directly passed on to customers and collected through revenues, which are the wholesale cost of natural gas and propane and gross receipts taxes. These internal non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, GAAP measures such as operating income or net income.\",\" \",\"\",\" \",\"\",\" \",\" \",\"\",\" \",\" \"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"yes\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-24 12:35:12','2015-11-24 12:35:12',NULL),(10910,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/easter-seals-kicks-off-the-holiday-season-with-worlds-largest-virtual-reality-tower-on-giving-tuesday-300183596.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-24 07:00:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 07:00:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/easter-seals-kicks-off-the-holiday-season-with-worlds-largest-virtual-reality-tower-on-giving-tuesday-300183596.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/easter-seals-kicks-off-the-holiday-season-with-worlds-largest-virtual-reality-tower-on-giving-tuesday-300183596.html\"],\"description\":\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHICAGO, Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- This year on Giving Tuesday, Easter Seals is proud to participate in the biggest virtual event happening during the holiday season.&#160; As one of eight founding partner charities, Easter Seals hopes to raise $15,000 in donations for children a\",\"content\":\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHICAGO, Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- This year on Giving Tuesday, Easter Seals is proud to participate in the biggest virtual event happening during the holiday season.&#160; As one of eight founding partner charities, Easter Seals hopes to raise $15,000 in donations for children a\",\"title\":\"Easter Seals kicks off the Holiday Season with World\'s Largest Virtual Reality Tower on Giving Tuesday\",\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[],\"copy\":[\"CHICAGO, Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- This year on Giving Tuesday, Easter Seals is proud to participate in the biggest virtual event happening during the holiday season.  As one of eight founding partner charities, Easter Seals hopes to raise $15,000 in donations for children and adults with disabilities to access vital services and support programs. \",\"Easter Seals is partnering with CrowdRise, the largest crowdfunding platform for good, for its second annual Giving Tuesday campaign.  This fun and friendly competition between charities offers a visual reflection of the combined philanthropic impact on Giving Tuesday: as donations are made, donors, organizations and everyone else can watch the tower grow brick by brick via a free virtual reality app available in the iTunes store and Google Play.

The incidence and prevalence of CTEPH are yet to be accurately determined and may be significantly underestimated.4  In fact, as many as 1 out of every 25 people who had a pulmonary embolism (even if they were treated with at least 3 months of anticoagulants), go on to develop CTEPH.*\",\"\\\"Because surgery can be an effective treatment for CTEPH, it is critical that physicians suspect and diagnose the condition.  Unfortunately, as demonstrated by this survey, recognition of CTEPH among primary care physicians is inadequate,\\\" said Richard Channick, M.D., director of Massachusetts General Hospital\'s Pulmonary Hypertension and Thromboendarterectomy Program.  \\\"We very much need further education to identify and treat these patients as quickly as possible.\\\" \",\"The survey of 604 PCPs, cardiologists and pulmonologists (approximately 200 from each group) was conducted online by Schlesinger Associates from August 10, 2015 to August 18, 2015. \",\"Additional findings illustrate that:\",\"\\\"Together with treating physicians, our goal is always to find ways to raise awareness about this misunderstood disease,\\\" said Dario Mirski, M.D., vice president and head, U.S. medical affairs at Bayer. \\\"For patients with CTEPH, the benefits of surgery may be very positive, and we hope the results of this survey help drive conversations about optimal diagnostic tools and treatment among physicians and the patient community.\\\"\",\"About the Physician Survey  The insights and findings represented above are based on a 2015 online survey conducted by Schlesinger Associates and sponsored by Bayer HealthCare. The survey was fielded from August 10, 2015 to August 18, 2015 among 202 PCPs, 202 cardiologists and 200 pulmonologists. For the survey, internal medicine physicians, family medicine physicians and general practitioners were considered PCPs.

With that in mind, the secure data delivery and email encryption experts at DataMotion have declared Cyber Monday 2015 as the inaugural \\\"Safe Internet Shopping Awareness Day\\\" in hopes of raising awareness among consumers and businesses to be safer when shopping online this, and every, holiday season.\",\"Since the name \\\"Cyber Monday\\\" was first coined in 2005, online sales have increased more than five times on the first Monday after Thanksgiving and cybercriminals are well aware of this. Online thieves deploy endless methods to dupe consumers into visiting fraudulent websites, which can install malware or spyware onto a user\'s machine, or divulging sensitive information that can be used for identity theft. Particularly at risk are businesses and the thieves know that roughly half of U.S. workers will shop online during work, according to a 2014 Cyber Monday survey by CareerBuilder. More than half (53 percent) of senior managers admit they will shop during the day along with 46 percent of lower-level professionals. Staffing firm Robert Half Technology reports that 69 percent of companies allowed online shopping in 2014. Therefore, it is in every company\'s best interest to educate employees on how to be vigilant and better protect themselves shopping online.\",\"In honor of Safe Internet Shopping Awareness Day, the experts at DataMotion recommend the following best practices for consumers to follow and businesses to teach their employees:\",\"\\\"Education and awareness are the greatest tools in fighting cybercrime. By starting \'Safe Internet Shopping Awareness Day\', we hope that people and businesses will educate themselves about staying safer when shopping online this Cyber Monday and throughout the holidays,\\\" said Bob Janacek, co-founder and chief technology officer at DataMotion. \\\"We encourage every person and business to raise their awareness and adopt good habits, which will reduce the risk for personal identity and corporate theft.

IRSA\'s audited annual and unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS. \",\"For the reasons summarized below, and in accordance with IFRS, IRSA did not consolidate IDBD in such financial statements.\",\"At both June 30 and September 30, 2015, IRSA had an indirect 49% interest in IDBD. On June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015, IFISA held an interest of 37.39% and 36.76%, respectively, in Cresud, which on both dates held a 64.3% interest in IRSA. Additionally, IFISA held an interest of 17.7% in IDBD on both dates. At both June 30 and September 30, 2015, IRSA, IFISA and Mr. Mordechai Ben-Moshe (\\\"MBM\\\") were parties to a joint control agreement (the \\\"Joint Control Agreement\\\") with respect to their respective investments in IDBD. Therefore, IRSA did not have effective control over IBDB on either of such dates. For this reason, and in accordance with IFRS, IRSA did not consolidate IDBD in its annual or most recent unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements.\",\"On October 11, 2015, IFISA (not IRSA) acquired shares representing an additional 14% of IDBD, and on such date the Joint Control Agreement was terminated. Due to the October 11 termination of the Joint Control Agreement, IRSA is currently assessing whether or not it should begin to consolidate IBDB commencing on the date as of which the Elsztain group (i.e., IFISA, IRSA and related companies) obtained effective control over IDBD. No conclusion has been reached yet.\",\"On October 9, 2015, IRSA filed with the SEC a request for a waiver of the provisions of Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X which would require IRSA to include in its annual report on Form 20-F the separate financial statements of IDBD as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 audited in accordance with US GAAS. IRSA filed this waiver request because IDBD does not have US GAAS financial statements, and IRSA believes that their preparation would take time and would impose an undue economic burden on IRSA. This issue is unrelated to IRSA\'s consolidation analysis. IRSA has no reason to believe that the SEC is conducting any kind of investigation with respect to IRSA\'s financial statements or otherwise.\",\"It should be noted that IDBD\'s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 and its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 were prepared in accordance with IFRS, audited under Israel GAAS by KPMG, and are publicly available on IDBD\'s website.\",\"All of IDBD\'s Debt is Non-Recourse to IRSA.\",\"Irrespective of whether IRSA consolidates IDBD\'s indebtedness in its future financial statements, none of such indebtedness is guaranteed by IRSA or secured by any of IRSA\'s assets. All of IDBD\'s indebtedness is non-recourse to IRSA.\",\"IRSA Has Complied with its Debt Covenants.\",\"IRSA\'s outstanding indebtedness includes its local bonds, its US$150 million Notes due 2017 and its US$150 million Notes due 2020. IRSA\'s debt instruments contain certain incurrence (not maintenance) covenants that limit the incurrence of indebtedness. IRSA has carefully reviewed all its debt agreements and believes that it is in compliance with all applicable covenants and, assuming no increase in IRSA\'s shareholding in IDBD, will remain in compliance even if it consolidates IDBD in its future financial statements.\",\"Investor Relations Department IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones S.A. + 5411 4323-7449 ir@irsa.com.ar www.irsa.com.ar Follow us on Twitter @irsair\"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"yes\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-24 14:41:34','2015-11-24 14:41:34',NULL),(11151,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gartner-positions-experian-as-a-challenger-in-the-magic-quadrant-for-data-quality-tools-2015-300183319.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-24 09:30:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 09:30:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gartner-positions-experian-as-a-challenger-in-the-magic-quadrant-for-data-quality-tools-2015-300183319.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gartner-positions-experian-as-a-challenger-in-the-magic-quadrant-for-data-quality-tools-2015-300183319.html\"],\"description\":\"BOSTON, Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Experian Data Quality, a leading provider of data quality software and services, today announced that it has been positioned as a Challenger in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Tools 2015 report based on Experian\'s completeness of vision and ability t\",\"content\":\"BOSTON, Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Experian Data Quality, a leading provider of data quality software and services, today announced that it has been positioned as a Challenger in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Tools 2015 report based on Experian\'s completeness of vision and ability t\",\"title\":\"Gartner positions Experian as a Challenger in the Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Tools 2015\",\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[],\"copy\":[\"BOSTON, Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Experian Data Quality, a leading provider of data quality software and services, today announced that it has been positioned as a Challenger in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Tools 2015 report based on Experian\'s completeness of vision and ability to execute. \",\"Data is one of the most significant assets that organizations consider when formulating a strategy.

The 10-City Composite increased 5.0% in the year to September compared to 4.7% previously. The 20-City Composite\'s year-over-year gain was 5.5% versus 5.1% in the year to September. After adjusting for the CPI core rate of inflation, the S&amp;P/Case Shiller National Home Price Index rose 3% from September 2014 to September 2015.\",\"San Francisco, Denver and Portland reported the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities with double-digit price increases of 11.2%, 10.9%, and 10.1%, respectively. Seventeen cities reported greater price increases in the year ending September 2015 versus the year ending August 2015. Phoenix had the longest streak of year-over-year increases, reporting a gain of 5.3% in September 2015, the tenth consecutive increase in annual price gains.  \",\"Month-over-MonthBefore seasonal adjustment, the National Index posted a gain of 0.2% month-over-month in September. The 10-City Composite and 20-City Composite both reported gains of 0.2% month-over-month in September. After seasonal adjustment, the National Index posted a gain of 0.8%, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites both increased 0.6% month-over-month. Fifteen of 20 cities reported increases in September before seasonal adjustment; after seasonal adjustment, 19 cities increased for the month.\",\"Analysis\\\"Home prices and housing continue to show strength with home prices rising at more than double the rate of inflation,\\\" says David M. Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. \\\"The general economy appeared to slow slightly earlier in the fall, but is now showing renewed strength. With unemployment at 5% and hints of higher inflation in the CPI, most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise its Fed Funds target range to 25 to 50 basis points, the first increase since 2006. While this will make news, it is not likely to push mortgage rates far above the recent level of 4% on 30 year conventional loans. In the last year, mortgage rates have moved in a narrow range as home prices have risen; it will take much more from the Fed to slow home price gains.\",\"\\\"The strength seen in home prices since the bottom in 2012 led some to wonder if we\'re entering a new bubble. While bubbles can only be reliably identified in hindsight, one useful measure compares the increase in home prices to the change in rents. The first chart below shows the year-over-year change in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index and the year-over-year change in the rent of primary residence series reported as part of the Consumer Price Index. Home prices are far more volatile. At the same time, the most recent data do not show a huge spread between the two series.\\\" \",\"Source: S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Prices, US Bureau of Labor Statistics\",\"\\\"Another question raised by consistent real (or inflation adjusted) home price increases is whether the prices are squeezing people out of the market. One measure of affordability is based on median income, median home price, and mortgage rate; a value of 100 on the chart below indicates a home buyer at the median income can afford the median price home. As shown on the chart, affordability is more than adequate for a median income buyer now but has slipped a bit recently.\\\"\",\"The chart below depicts the annual returns of the U.S. National, the 10-City Composite and the 20-City Composite Home Price Indices. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which covers all nine U.S. census divisions, recorded a 4.9% annual gain in September 2015. The 10-City and 20-City Composites reported year-over-year increases of 5.0% and 5.5%.\",\"This chart shows the index levels for the U.S. National, 10-City and 20-City Composite Indices. As of September 2015, average home prices for the MSAs within the 10-City and 20-City Composites are back to their winter 2007 levels. Measured from their June/July 2006 peaks, the peak-to-current decline for both Composites is approximately 11-13%.

Their findings, published in the December issue of Diabetes (http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db15-0688), demonstrate for the first time that non-endocrine pancreatic tissue (NEPT) can be reprogrammed to respond to blood glucose without the use of any genetic manipulation, representing a safer and more efficient method to increase the limited supply of insulin-producing islet cells for transplant into people with type 1 diabetes. \",\"Scientists have known for some time that one of the interesting features of NEPT (which comprises near 98 percent of the organ and is not a primary target of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes) is its high plasticity, meaning that the non-endocrine pancreatic cells can be reprogrammed, or turned into, other cell types or tissues. However, conventional approaches to cell reprogramming entail genetic modification, which poses health risks to patients and has other drawbacks. The DRI team has pioneered the use of a novel, non-invasive means of cell reprogramming, which is expected to have a shorter path for testing in clinical transplantation trials.\",\"\\\"We discovered that the exposure of human pancreatic exocrine cells to BMP-7 alone results in their efficient conversion into insulin-producing clusters that respond to glucose both in the laboratory setting and after transplantation into diabetic rodents. Cells generated in this manner produced insulin levels between 50 and 250 times higher than previously published by other teams, which used genetically engineered viruses plus treatment with additional agents that are known to cause unpredictable genetic patterns in cells. What we\'ve accomplished, a non-genetic conversion of human pancreatic exocrine-to-endocrine cells, is a safer and simpler alternative to genetic reprogramming,\\\" explained Juan Dominguez-Bendala, Ph.D., the study\'s co-lead investigator and director of stem cell development for translational research at the DRI. \\\"The relative simplicity of our approach, coupled with its high efficiency, makes it a prime candidate for translation to patients with diabetes.\\\"\",\"In type 1 diabetes, the insulin-producing islets cells of the pancreas have been mistakenly destroyed by the immune system, requiring patients to manage their blood sugar levels through a daily regimen of insulin therapy. Islet transplantation has allowed many patients to live without the need for insulin injections after receiving a transplant of donor cells. Some patients who have received islet transplants at the DRI have been insulin-independent for more than a decade. However, the procedure remains limited to the most severe cases of type 1 diabetes due to several factors, among them the limited supply of insulin-producing islet cells. Currently, transplanted islets come from donated cadaver pancreases. DRI researchers continue to build on progress in islet transplantation by developing the DRI BioHub, a bioengineered mini organ that mimics the native pancreas, as a means of overcoming the remaining challenges. These newly created insulin-producing cells could be implanted within a DRI BioHub, addressing the cell supply issue and enabling researchers to treat millions with diabetes in the United States and around the world.  \",\"\\\"We are now working on improving the cellular reprogramming process and hope to have a more clinically viable protocol that we could offer to patients living with this disease in the near future,\\\" said Dr. Dominguez-Bendala. \",\"About the Diabetes Research InstituteThe Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine leads the world in cure-focused research. As the largest and most comprehensive research center dedicated to curing diabetes, the DRI is aggressively working to develop a biological cure by restoring natural insulin production and normalizing blood sugar levels without imposing other risks. Researchers have already shown that transplanted islet cells allow patients to live without the need for insulin therapy. The DRI is now building upon these promising outcomes by developing the DRI BioHub, a bioengineered mini organ that mimics the native pancreas, and is testing various BioHub platforms in preclinical and clinical studies.

Many parents experience a variety of stresses, including worrying about their baby\'s life and health while also worrying about the financial implications of their baby\'s hospitalization. Some of these parents will develop postpartum depression (PPD) and even posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at higher rates than other new parents, and their distress can interfere with the normal process of bonding between parent and baby.  Impaired bonding can in turn jeopardize the baby\'s long-term physical, social and emotional development.  The benefits of psychosocial support in this group of parents have been well documented, and yet there are no national program standards to guide healthcare professionals in how to best provide this support.  At the same time, doctors and nurses caring for these fragile babies are themselves under stress due to the high-stakes nature of the care they provide, and they, too, can benefit from support.  \",\"Dr. Mike Hynan, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychology at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, also a workgroup Co-Chair, is especially pleased that a primary recommendation is for larger NICUs to have psychologists on their staff to address psychological needs of both parents as well as staff.  Dr. Hynan wrote, \\\"Intensifying the focus in the NICU on the emotional well-being of parents is the next frontier.  Movement towards this goal will also be aided by a NICU culture which values the emotional well-being of all staff, encouraged to work together in an interdisciplinary fashion.\\\"\",\"Currently 28 professional and parent support organizations have indicated their support for the workgroup\'s recommendations.  The issue of Journal of Perinatology in which the recommendations are published can be found at http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v35/n1s/index.html#rv.

The campaign that will directly reach over 7 million MSM around the world is called Blue Ribbon Boys (BlueRibbonBoys.org).\",\"\\n\",\"***In order to encourage global participation in Blue Ribbon Boys, Hornet is giving away free premium memberships to new users that sign up using this link: http://hrnt.it/blueribbonboys during November and December.\",\"Launching within the app on November 24th, one week before World AIDS Day, the Blue Ribbon Boys campaign will prompt all Hornet users to answer a short series of yes or no questions about their sexual health. Questions will pertain to HIV and STI testing, ARV (anti-retroviral) treatment, PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis), viral load, disclosure, stigma, condom and lubricant use, and other prevention methods. \",\"Based on their answers, those who qualify will receive a blue ribbon icon on their profile photo signifying their personal commitment to sexual health, irrespective of their HIV status. Men who do not meet the standard will be offered recommendations for ways to protect and improve their sexual health so they can become a Blue Ribbon Boy. The campaign will grow and evolve over the coming months and adapt as treatment and prevention methods improve and become available in different regions.\",\"\\\"Blue Ribbon Boys modernizes sexual health messaging by asking Hornet users to be more mindful about their sex play given the effective prevention options at their disposal. It also invites men to take action in response to the unavailability of prevention and treatment tools they want and need,\\\" said MSMGF Executive Director, Dr. George Ayala. \",\"MSMGF and Hornet are tenacious advocates for unfettered access to and early initiation of antiretroviral medications for all MSM living with HIV. Both organizations are also campaigning for widespread availability and proper use of PrEP among HIV-negative men at significant risk for HIV, aligned with CDC and WHO guidelines. The goal of the BRB campaign is HIV viral suppression across all global communities. \",\"\\\"Leveraging social technology on such a massive scale is one of the ways we will be able to make a big difference in global health,\\\" says Hornet founder Sean Howell. \\\"As a large social media platform, we can be a megaphone to the good work that MSMGF is doing.\\\"\",\"Blue Ribbon Boys is breaking new ground in reaching MSM in many low- and middle-income countries where basic services may not be available but the prevalence of smart phones is widespread. It also directly targets young MSM who are early adopters of technology. Young people (under 25) are at increased risk for HIV, comprising over 40% of new HIV infections worldwide. \",\"In cases where Hornet users hit a roadblock, where they are unable to access treatment or prevention services, they will be directed to two global petitions: one is for HIV-negative men who want access to PrEP and the other is for HIV-positive men who demand access to ARV treatment. \",\"Although MSM represent only about 4% of the male population, they are disproportionately affected by HIV. In low- and middle-income countries they are 19 times more likely to be infected with HIV compared with the general population. HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men across North, South and Central America, South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa ranges from 14% to 18%. Even as HIV incidence is in decline worldwide, the rate of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men remains unchanged and is increasing in some high-income countries like the United States.\",\"MSMGF is an expanding global network focused on full sexual health and human rights for all men who have sex with men.\",\"Learn more about MSMGF at MSMGF.org\",\"Learn more about Hornet at hornetapp.com\",\"Media Contacts: MSMGF: Jack Mackenroth, jmackenroth@msmgf.org Hornet: Jack Song, jack@speakcomm.com\",\"Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151116/288388LOGO \",\" \"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"yes\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-24 16:08:55','2015-11-24 16:08:55',NULL),(11287,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cadence-receives-customers-choice-award-for-automotive-ip-paper-presented-at-tsmc-oip-ecosystem-forum-300183647.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-24 10:45:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 10:45:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cadence-receives-customers-choice-award-for-automotive-ip-paper-presented-at-tsmc-oip-ecosystem-forum-300183647.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cadence-receives-customers-choice-award-for-automotive-ip-paper-presented-at-tsmc-oip-ecosystem-forum-300183647.html\"],\"description\":\"SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

ChatGame lets you use a cool, and pretty adorable version of yourself. \",\"\\\"We\'re trying to make communication more interesting and full with love and help people to have a better communication,\\\" said Bruce Yu, Co-Founder. \\\"Nowadays, a lot of communication tools we have still couldn\'t bridge the distance between people. It\'s not easy to show people\'s feelings in their daily conversations through texting. Using video calls is the best way to get closer to the people you love. Although people know making a video call is the best way to let their feelings show, yet many people don\'t prefer that because they feel less confident and insecure. We are trying to give them a solution, change the way of video calling, make it more enjoyable and less pressure, more interesting, natural and give users the confidence they need. Helping people to see their loved ones and express their love in the most beautiful way.\\\" \",\"Features:\",\"ChatGame is a mobile application that allows you to make phone calls, HD video calls and send text messages to all other ChatGame users for free. It is available for iOS and Androids so far, and requires a 3G or Wi-Fi connection to use. ChatGame has just updated its last mobile app, and in the updated version i.e. 3.0.63, there are various and unique features, like new and interactive user interface, numerous videos avatars and fun backgrounds that you can switch freely. The updated version is more avatar-focused, which adds flair to chatting and makes it more fun! The video call takes less from your Internet data, and it\'s almost equal to the voice call. You can start your video call instantly from your recent contact list. It\'s simple, fast and easy with ChatGame. You can also make new friends and reconnect with your old friends by inviting your friends from other social media apps through ChatGame. \",\"Seemingly wherever you go on the net these days, you need an avatar to enhance the dimensions of your personality and your sense of humor. Sometimes you don\'t want to share your identity and that\'s why the default way of video calling is becoming unfavorable, so choosing a cartoony avatar is the most appealing option. \",\"In addition to that, face to face meeting is the most natural way to communicate. But if that\'s inconvenient, then video calling would be a preferable choice. People pay more attention when they can see the people they\'re talking to. Unfortunately despite all the benefits, video calling is incredibly easy to screw up. Well, that\'s not going to happen anymore. With the new beautification features of ChatGame, you won\'t have to adjust the lights or worry about how you look like while video calling. ChatGame takes the pressure away and instantly putting your best face forward! ChatGame\'s patent video effects provides a better and unique way for you to connect with anyone worldwide, while making sure you are having fun with a personal touch.\",\"Media Assets: http://tinyurl.com/ChatGameMediaAssets\",\"Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6badB1vN47Q\",\"ChatGame is available in the AppStore and Google Play Store\",\"Join our Facebook for updates and events https://www.facebook.com/officialChatGame \",\"About ChatGame:\",\"Founded in 2014, ChatGame is fused together by passion, science, technology and art.

Smartphone financing will become the norm, Indonesia will join India as the next big smartphone market after China, and smartwatches will start to cannibalize fitness bands.\",\"Ken Hyers, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, \\\"Smartphone installment plans and lease-to-own programs will go global in 2016, as OEMs take programs that first gained traction in the United States to other markets. Apple iPhone Upgrade Program and ZTE SmartPay are among early leaders in using direct financing to boost smartphone shipments or enhance customer stickiness. Operators, like Sprint, will feel the squeeze from vendor-led financing and will need to respond vigorously with their own customer loyalty and lease-to-own programs.\\\"\",\"Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, \\\"Indonesia will join India as the next big smartphone market after China in 2016. As China\'s growth slows due to maturity, smartphone vendors will increasingly search for fresh growth in other emerging countries. India and Indonesia together will represent 13 percent of all smartphone shipments worldwide next year. India is set to overtake the United States as the second largest smartphone market by 2017. India and Indonesia will be the fastest-growing smartphone markets among the world\'s ten biggest countries from 2016 to 2020. We also predict some smartphone and component manufacturing to shift out of China and into India and Indonesia during the coming years, for closer supply proximity to these growing pools of demand.\\\"\",\"Cliff Raskind, Director at Strategy Analytics, added, \\\"In wearables, the Apple Watch will prove a relatively popular accessory for smartphone owners during the busy Q4 2015 holiday season and into 2016 when the next generation of smartwatch models will be launched. We forecast global smartwatch shipments to grow 57 percent in 2016, while fitness bands will grow just 8 percent next year. Smartwatches optimized for health and fitness, such as the Moto 360 Sport, are emerging as strong alternatives to Fitbit and other players in the fitness band category. Just as multi-function smartphones displaced most feature phones, multi-function smartwatches that support fitness apps, social feeds and music-to-go will eventually cannibalize mid-to-high-tier fitness bands.\\\"\",\"\",\"Exhibit 1: Top Global Smartphone Trends in 2016\",\"The full report, Top 10 Mobile Device Predictions for 2016, is published by the Strategy Analytics Wireless Device Strategies (WDS) service, details of which can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/oyxmrno.\",\"About Strategy Analytics:\",\"Strategy Analytics is a global, independent research and consulting firm.

The stress on the body due to lacking nutrients is compounded with a sedentary lifestyle, which can increase her body\'s requirements for some nutrients such as Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E.\\\"   \",\"femMED\'s solutions are developed by doctors, and are easily recognized and understood by consumers. By eliminating the \'guess work\' often associated with supplements, femMED can ensure that women are only consuming what they actually require.\",\"Dr. Al-Hamwi continued: \\\"As much as 75% of people in the UAE or either overweight or obese.  There is no question that all people should make a habit of eating healthily, but supplements are an effective way of boosting the immune system and replenishing supplies of rapidly depleting nutrients. Supplements should always be taken in partnership with a healthy diet - not as an alternative.\\\" \",\"Manufactured in Canada, femMED\'s comprehensive solutions stand out in a market dominated by single-ingredient products. In the UAE, five supplement lines are available, including Bone Health; Hair, Skin, and Nails; Pregnancy; Pregnancy + Ginger; and Multi + Antioxidants.\",\"About femMED \",\"Founded in 2007, femMED is a brand of comprehensive supplements designed specifically for the unique needs of women. femMED\'s line of 20 doctor-formulated remedies provide natural solutions to women\'s most common health concerns, at every age and stage of life.

Collectively, these assets produced nearly 24.5 million megawatt hours of electricity from July through September 2015, the hottest months of the year.  (One megawatt powers approximately 1,000 homes.)  Continued strong performance throughout the winter months will help ensure FirstEnergy is well-positioned to meet demand peaks such as those experienced during recent harsh winters. \",\"To prepare for frigid temperatures and icy conditions, plant operators installed storm barriers to protect plant equipment from winter weather, set up heating elements that provide additional warmth to piping, provided temporary heaters in areas most susceptible to cold, added anti-freeze to equipment, and increased fuel stockpiles at coal-fired facilities.  \",\"Throughout the winter, operators run water pumps more often to avoid freezing, keep oil flow within transformers more constant, and take precautions to prevent cooling towers from icing.  FirstEnergy will also stay in close contact with PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., the regional grid operator, to avoid scheduling plant maintenance work during periods of high electricity demand.\",\"Winter preparations also were supported by a number of long-term reliability projects completed at FirstEnergy generating facilities this year.  A new, large transformer that connects Beaver Valley with the electrical grid was delivered to the plant this fall, where it will be maintained as a spare that can be quickly and efficiently installed should there be an issue with one of the two transformers in use.  In addition, the company spent more than $60 million on reliability upgrades at its Springdale natural gas plant in southwest Pennsylvania, ensuring the facility will generate affordable and low-emitting electricity for years to come.\",\"FirstEnergy is a diversified energy company dedicated to safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation\'s largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

Smart cities apply technology to become more efficient in the use of resources, saving energy, improving services, and promoting sustainable development.- The goal of a smart city is to solve major problems that citizens face daily through modernized management that encourages greater interaction between citizens and institutions to achieve better quality of life.- The smart city concept is still developing in Latin America as many cities confront problems such as drug trafficking, pollution, and congestion. Management is not known for efficiency, and there is much less transparency than in cities located in more developed regions.Frost &amp; Sullivan analysts reviewed numerous smart city projects and initiatives being undertaken globally and found 8 parameters that were indicative of what constitutes a smart city. Frost &amp; Sullivan has defined smart cities as those that are built on \\\"smart\\\" and \\\"intelligent\\\" solutions and technology that will lead to adoption of at least out of parameters: smart governance and smart education, smart energy, smart building, smart mobility, smart infrastructure, smart technology, smart healthcare, and smart citizen. - This study identifies key smart cities in Latin America, what has been done in their development, and the long path to follow.

Upon reviewing the full record and other documents filed or submitted by the parties, the Department determined that the taxpayer did not meet all the requirements under the bad debt and, therefore, was not entitled to the deduction. The basis for the Department\'s determination included the fact that the bank and not the taxpayer held the benefits of holding the card account receivables, including the right to payment for interest and finance charges associated with each transaction and the ability to charge off bad debt on its federal income tax return when a cardholder defaulted. Due to this and other factors, the taxpayer\'s refund claim was denied. To read the full opinion, see Office Depot, Inc. v. North Carolina Department of Revenue, Office of Administrative Hearings, November 9, 2015. \",\"About RyanRyan is an award-winning global tax services firm, with the largest indirect and property tax practices in North America and the seventh largest corporate tax practice in the United States.

There could not be a more critical time to help families affected by substance use and abuse give their babies the healthiest possible start in life, which is why we celebrate the Protecting Our Infants Act\'s advancement into law today. Congress and President Obama recognized the urgent need to address neonatal abstinence syndrome and responded, working across both sides of the aisle to do what is right for our mothers and newborns,\\\" said AAP President Sandra G. Hassink, MD, FAAP. \",\"\\\"No infant should begin life by suffering the pain of drug withdrawal.  The March of Dimes commends Congress and President Obama for bringing much-needed attention to the dramatic increase in the number of infants born exposed to opioids and other drugs,\\\" stated March of Dimes President Dr. Jennifer L. Howse. \\\"The Protecting Our Infants Act is a critical first step toward reducing the terrible toll of neonatal abstinence syndrome. We thank the bill sponsors – Senators Mitch McConnell and Bob Casey, and Representatives Katherine Clark and Steve Stivers -- for their tremendous efforts on behalf of drug-exposed babies. We look forward to working with authorities at the federal, state and local levels to prevent infant drug exposure and treat those affected.\\\"\",\"\\\"The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is extremely gratified that today, President Obama signed the bipartisan Protecting Our Infants Act into law,\\\" said ACOG President, Mark S. DeFrancesco, MD. \\\"This law takes a major step in addressing opioid use during pregnancy while giving women the care that is right for them. As ob-gyns, we recognize the importance of combatting the abuse of prescription opioids across the country while offering non-punitive, family-centered medical treatment. Together, we will address this ongoing public health crisis and ensure a healthy outcome for both mother and baby.\\\" \",\"Reports show the significant rise of opiate use and abuse has led to an alarming increase in the rate of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS refers to medical complications associated with drug withdrawal in newborns due to exposure to opioids or other drugs in utero. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of mothers found to be using opioids during pregnancy increased from 1.19 to 5.63 per 1,000 U.S. hospital births. Further, in that same time period, the number of babies born with NAS increased from 1.20 to 3.39 per 1000 hospital births per year. Babies born with NAS often need to be hospitalized for weeks, are difficult to console, and can suffer from seizures and other complications. Currently, there are no standardized guidelines for diagnosis and treatment for these newborns, and there is an urgent need for more research to optimize their health. \",\"Specifically, the Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015, introduced by Reps. Katherine Clark (D- Mass.) and Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to identify and make available recommendations for the prevention and treatment of prenatal opioid use disorders and diagnosis and treatment of NAS, evaluate and coordinate federal efforts to research and respond to NAS, and assist state health agencies with data collection. \",\"The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015 (H.R. 1462), which has 99 bipartisan cosponsors, on Sept. 8, 2015. The U.S. Senate passed an almost-identical companion bill (S. 799), which garnered 22 bipartisan cosponsors, on Oct. 22, 2015.

China will account for approximately 45% of the global demand and developing countries are expected to account for a bigger market share over the next ten years as their economies develop further. Packaging sales in the emerging economies are expected to continue to show strong growth as both increased consumption and demand for consumer goods drive the need for more sophisticated packaging.The aluminium packaging industry is expected to continue showing stable development at a considerable volume level. However the industry has been negatively impacted by rising prices for raw materials. Combined with the fact that many countries are still recovering from the recent economic crisis, it is expected to be a tight hold on margins. Whilst the financial conditions for the growth of aluminium foil packaging may not be particularly favourable, consumer sentiment is expected to be positive over 2015-2025.The increased focus placed on sustainability will play a significant role in creating this positive sentiment and the developing regions are expected to drive growth over 2015-2025. This will be largely due to increasing market penetration and rising incomes in developing countries. Rising incomes will encourage consumer spending and the demand for aluminium foil packaging will increase as a consequence. Furthermore the palpable immaturity levels in packaging markets in the developing regions will extend to aluminium foil packaging, and will allow for strong and sustained growth over 2015-2025.How this 178 page report will inform you:What is the future of the aluminum foil packaging market?

Growing investment in thermal power generation infrastructure, particularly in emerging economies, is driving the demand for steam turbines across the globe. Utilities across Asia-Pacific and the Middle East &amp; Africa are expanding generation capacity to meet growing domestic electricity demand. Steam turbines find important application in gas-fired combined cycle plants, as well as Combined Heat and Power (CHP/Cogeneration) plants. The increasing number of natural gas based combined cycle plants in the Americas and the Middle East, where natural gas prices have been very affordable over the past decade, is also increasing the demand for steam turbines.Application in coal dominates the global market:Coal application of steam turbine held the largest market share in terms of value, across all regions of the world, except Europe, where nuclear application was ahead by a wide margin. Asia-Pacific in particular was heavily dominated by coal application, and the region is expected to witness the highest growth for this application during the forecast period. However, growth will be subdued in the Americas and especially Europe, as policy measures by authorities make it tougher to build new fossil fuel fired power plants. Asia-Pacific: The fastest growing region for steam turbine marketAsia-Pacific is home to some of the fastest growing emerging economies in the world and has the largest share of human population among all regions. Increasing demand for electricity in the region coupled with the intent of respective countries to plug the demand and supply gap has led to large scale plans for capacity expansion. China and India, two of the largest economies in the region, are together expected to add close to 60% of all new thermal power generation capacity in the world in the next five years. These infrastructure investments are projected to drive demand for steam turbines at a healthy pace.Leading players of this market have been profiled with their recent developments and other strategic activities. These include Alstom SA (France), Siemens AG (Germany), General Electric (U.S.), Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (Japan), and Toshiba Corporation (Japan) among others.

For the first time, language in the bill, supported by American Humane Association, mandates that our heroic military working dogs will be returned to U.S. soil upon retirement, and that their human handlers and their families – to whom these dogs mean more than anyone else –will be given first right of adoption. It is estimated that each military dog saves the lives of between 150-200 servicemen and women by detecting IEDs and hidden weapons caches. The language was introduced in the House and the Senate by Congressman Frank LoBiondo and Senator Claire McCaskill. \",\"Prior to the passage of this groundbreaking act, military working dogs were not guaranteed retirement on the home front, and some were retired overseas, making them civilians and rendering them ineligible for transportation home on military aircraft. Over the past year, American Humane Association has privately funded the transportation home of 21 military working dogs and contract working dogs and helped reunite them with their former human handlers. In July of 2014, American Humane Association held a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill to shed light on the need to bring home all our veterans and press for long-overdue changes to the NDAA.  \",\"\\\"This is a momentous day for all veterans,\\\" said Dr. Robin Ganzert, American Humane Association president and CEO. \\\"We applaud Congress and the President for passing and signing the bill with the language we provided and stepping up for our brave K-9 Battle Buddy teams who have benefited and will continue to benefit from their service together.\\\" \",\"\\\"The NDAA and its passage will ensure that our four-legged veterans will finally have their chance to come home and live a comfortable quiet life, hopefully with a handler they deployed with or a fellow veteran,\\\" said Lance Corporal Jeff DeYoung, USMC (Ret.) who was reunited with his Military War Dog Cena with the help of American Humane Association. \\\"The language in the NDAA is about healing, healing veterans and their families. These dogs have so much love to give…it\'s time we show some in return.\\\"\",\"Lifesaving Work Continues at Home\",\"For some of our brave servicemen and women, the return home from war is not the end of the battle. Every year thousands of our nation\'s veterans are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress, and easing back into society is difficult or even terrifying.  Reuniting handlers and war dogs (who themselves can suffer from PTS) helps both heal. In this way the bond between veterans that saved lives on the battlefield now saves lives at home.\",\"A happy – and healthy – retirement for America\'s military hero dogs\",\"The passage of the 2016 NDAA is the second major victory for military dogs accomplished with the help of American Humane Association. In its July 2014 briefing, the organization called on the private sector to provide veterinary care for all retired military dogs. On Veterans Day 2014, American Humane Association announced an arrangement with New Jersey\'s Red Bank Veterinary Hospital to provide free specialized veterinary care to all retired canine veterans.\",\"\\\"These heroes have served their country with valor, and saved the lives of our servicemen and women while risking their own,\\\" said John Payne, chairman of the board for American Humane Association. \\\"It is essential that we step up and care for these warriors who did – and continue to do – so much for us and all those who served alongside them. We owe them a debt of gratitude.\\\"\",\"With their repatriation, handler adoption and specialized health care now assured, Dr. Ganzert declared, \\\"This is a great day for military heroes on both ends of the leash. We believe ALL our veterans – two-footed and four-footed -- should come back to a hero\'s welcome, a loving, forever home, and the happy, healthy, and dignified retirement they so deserve after a lifetime of service to their country.\\\"\",\"To learn more about American Humane Association please visit www.AmericanHumane.org.  \",\"About American Humane Association American Humane Association is the country\'s first national humane organization and the only one dedicated to protecting both children and animals.

Ultimate Excursions reviews these safety concerns and what they mean for American vacationers.\",\"While the majority of Americans have heard about the safety issues which are occurring in Mexico, many assume these warnings and alerts relate to all parts of the country. This is severely impacting the tourism industry and leading to dwindling numbers of tourists from the U.S., even in otherwise \\\"safe\\\" destinations.  While organized criminal groups, violent crimes and concern for the safety of citizens and those visiting have led the U.S. Department of State to issue a travel warning regarding the safety of certain areas of the country, the vast majority of the country remains safe. \",\"While many have deferred travel, millions of Americans still travel in and out of popular Mexican cities each year. Continued updates to the travel alert issued by the U.S. have shown small improvement in many areas including its prime tourist locations, Cancun and the Riviera Maya.\",\"What this means for American\'s who are looking to travel to Mexico, is that as an informed traveler, it is important to research your destination, know what to avoid and what to watch for when you travel. Mexico is an amazing country with a rich culture and heritage and thousands of sites and areas worth exploring, as long as travelers know where it is safe to explore, they can travel with very little concerns. For those looking to travel to Mexico from the U.S., only 8 of Mexico\'s over 30 states are off limits. In an additional 12 states, travelers are advised to exercise caution, while all others have no travel alerts in effect. \",\"Travelers can find out more details about this travel alert by visiting travel.state.gov.\",\"Ultimate Excursions is a leader in the resort marketing and development industry.

From advanced monitoring equipment to hi-tech control systems, vendors are incorporating all these features in their generators to differentiate from their own previous product portfolio.According to the report, to complement the economic growth and to satisfy the demand of the growing population, both the Chinese and Indian governments are investing profusely for the development of infrastructure in the countries. These nations are focusing on the development of infrastructure as a critical area for development of the overall economy. This drives the building construction market in APAC despite the soaring prices of properties.Further, the report states that price is the major decisive factor for most of the end-users because they have tight budgets and increased expenses. The customers expect to have a generator with additional functionality and reliability but at a lower price. Therefore, many vendors are reducing their product prices to seize the demand from cost-driven companies and SMEs, resulting in increasing competition among the vendors over a period of time.\",\"The market has been segmented based on: \",\"Key vendors \",\"Other prominent vendors \",\"For more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/qwttm8/global_stationary \",\"Media Contact: Laura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\"],\"answers\":[{\"deal\":\"no\",\"feedback\":\"Type here...\"}]}','2015-11-26 07:18:05','2015-11-26 07:18:05',NULL),(11917,1,8,NULL,NULL,'{\"id\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pet-supplies-in-the-us-10th-edition---reviews-marketer-trends-including-detailed-mass-market-share-breakouts-mergers-and-acquisitions-and-category-leaders-300184758.html\",\"date_published\":\"2015-11-26 00:10:00 -0500\",\"last_updated\":\"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 00:10:00 -0500\",\"url\":\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pet-supplies-in-the-us-10th-edition---reviews-marketer-trends-including-detailed-mass-market-share-breakouts-mergers-and-acquisitions-and-category-leaders-300184758.html\",\"urls\":[\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pet-supplies-in-the-us-10th-edition---reviews-marketer-trends-including-detailed-mass-market-share-breakouts-mergers-and-acquisitions-and-category-leaders-300184758.html\"],\"description\":\"DUBLIN, Nov. 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- \\n\\nResearch and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/44v9gv/pet_supplies_in) has announced the addition of the \\\"Pet Supplies in the U.S., 10th Edition\\\" report to their offering.\\n\\n\\nPackaged Facts\' 10th edition of Pet Supplies in the U.S. compiles ex\",\"content\":\"DUBLIN, Nov. 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- \\n\\nResearch and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/44v9gv/pet_supplies_in) has announced the addition of the \\\"Pet Supplies in the U.S., 10th Edition\\\" report to their offering.\\n\\n\\nPackaged Facts\' 10th edition of Pet Supplies in the U.S. compiles ex\",\"title\":\"Pet Supplies in the U.S., 10th Edition - Reviews Marketer Trends Including Detailed Mass-Market Share Breakouts, Mergers and Acquisitions, and Category Leaders\",\"authors\":[],\"categories\":[],\"copy\":[\"DUBLIN, Nov. 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- \",\"Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/44v9gv/pet_supplies_in) has announced the addition of the \\\"Pet Supplies in the U.S., 10th Edition\\\" report to their offering.\",\"Packaged Facts\' 10th edition of Pet Supplies in the U.S. compiles extensive and proprietary survey data on pet product trends, consumers, and pets, and carefully examines key factors influencing market growth.

Latin America has the highest projected growth at 12.7%, and Asia, (excluding Japan), is second with growth projected at 11.5%.\",\"Australia continues to face increased healthcare expenditure. In 2013-2014, total government funded healthcare was nearly 68%. Federal government healthcare expenditure declined from 43.5% in 2008-2009 to 41.2% in 2013-2014. In real terms, out of pocket expenditure increased by 6.2% from 2012-2013 to 2013-2014. Public hospital services accounted for 29.6% of total health expenditure, followed closely by primary healthcare spending.\",\"Australia\'s complex funding system with multiple sources of funding, such as, national insurance, private insurance and government and state funds that cover fragments of the care continuum have created redundancies and inefficiencies in the system. In a recent research, the State of Victoria highlighted the need for a complete overhaul of the insurance system.\",\"Australia\'s aging population is growing faster than the young and working age population. 63% of adult Australians are either overweight or obese and 1.1 million live with diabetes. 15% of all deaths in Australia stem from coronary heart disease, followed closely by cerebrovascular disease. Supporting an aging population and managing chronic diseases more efficiently are Australia\'s most urgent needs; and combined with escalating costs, is a compelling case for convergence in the healthcare sector, said Maz Khan, Industry Director, Australia &amp; New Zealand, Transformational Health, Frost &amp; Sullivan.\",\"Tapping into their low-cost development potential, an increasing number of healthcare products will be created in emerging markets and subsequently introduced into developed countries. These changing paradigms of product development and geographic rollouts are to mitigate the growing burden of healthcare costs of these regions. \",\"Systemic inefficiencies are keen driving factors for technology in healthcare. Avoidable in-patient visits and readmissions can be reduced through effective monitoring and long-term management. This requires regular data capture, analysis and interpretation in a manner that the patient can take action based on the results. Telehealth can help improve healthcare access in remote and rural areas where 10.7% of the population struggle with limited healthcare-provider density because infrastructure development is lacking and physicians prefer to work in urban centres. \",\"Advanced medical technology companies are looking for a creative platform that enables them to provide solutions along the continuum of care, adapting to the \\\"owning the disease\\\" approach by migrating from an intervention-focused business model to convergent care. Pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers are seeking means to improve patient interaction and engagement with their products to improve patient adherence, and ultimately, improve outcomes. \",\"Connected Health \",\"Australia\'s Healthcare IT (HCIT) market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.1% from 2015 to 2019, impelled by increasing investments seen in cloud and mobility, an industry-wide call for interoperability and the increasing need for compliance, transparency and performance benchmarking.\",\"The telemedicine market in Australia and New Zealand is expected to record a CAGR of 43.5% from 2015 to 2019. The telemedicine market in Australia has been bolstered by government incentives in the past and is now moving towards integrated platforms and hardware-independent, vendor-neutral solutions.\",\"Although a fragmented market targeted towards consumers, and with little participation from hesitant healthcare providers, Australia\'s mobile health market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 57.1%, but needs to move towards an integrated solution-based approach in order to provide holistic care.\",\"\\\"Australia has achieved some significant milestones in HCIT. The transition from the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record (PCEHR) to the My eHealth Record involves an AUD485 million rescue package to revamp the national EHR and make it more patient-centric. This includes trialing an opt-out model.  St. Stephen\'s at Hervey Bay, operated by UnitingCare Health is Australia\'s first digital hospital. The AUD96 million dollar facility leverages completely digital systems, including EMRs, patient management systems and drug dispensing,\\\" stated Khan. \",\"One key goal of the My eHealth Record is to improve patient engagement. This will involve integrating electronic medical records for oneself and those under one\'s care across multiple care settings into a single platform, enabling patient action and ownership over health data and facilitating seamless and reliable information capture from devices, apps and wearables as well as provide regulations and guidelines that allow safe, secure and meaningful use of patient data, including health data.\",\"To provide a more patient centric approach in healthcare delivery, a high level of patient engagement on the continuum of care is required. Telehealth platforms that enhance patients\' involvement in wellness and disease management will eventually take centre-stage in Australia. Consumers will be expected to play a major role in healthcare delivery; no longer simply passive recipients of care, they will be actively involved in decision making, and the first step in this direction would be giving patients data ownership and encouraging them to manage their own health information. \",\"With increasing emphasis on community care and rehabilitative services, better care coordination, especially to support an aging population, will be a critical need. This will entail moving beyond the EHR to provide a vendor-neutral platform to collect comprehensive patient data on a regular basis – so vendors will have to move beyond the EMR and expand their value proposition to beyond hospital care. \",\"In spite of the aggressive industry push and government mandates to improve interoperability, smooth, comprehensive and efficient information exchange continues to be a challenge globally. Software and devices from different vendors often don\'t communicate and healthcare providers need to use multiple channels and interfaces as well as spend heavily on IT in order to access complete information. Data exchange between hospitals continues to be chaotic even in a country like the US where an estimated 75% of hospitals exchange data with other health institutions. \",\"This situation will be further exacerbated in the next 5 years as the industry goes through the following transformation:\",\"Khan concluded, \\\"Today, in healthcare individuals are often segmented into broad demographic caterogisations. This one-size-fits-all approach leads to initiatives that have low compliance, and often fail to achieve desired outcomes. By creating a more comprehensive profile of individual patients, healthcare stakeholders are discovering new ways to engage and truly impact healthy results.\\\"\",\"Maz Khan will be presenting these insights, \'Telehealth, How It\'s Transforming Healthcare Delivery\' at the 2015 GIL Australia congress (http://ww2.frost.com/event/calendar/gil-australia-2015) to be held at the Hilton Hotel Sydney, Australia on 3rd December 2015.
